            "what's everybody how's going today joined special guest kyle web dev simplified lot might know he's got really big channel web development simplifying uh who've watched channel last months might remember made reaction video video kyle made talked thing might not want work fang kind gave opposite opinion either way recently paired decided collaboration we're really excited we'll bring today 10 important web development tips things know we've identified jump kyle kind introduce want say filmed really fun video kyle's channel put test basically quizzed javascript sort trivia knowledge internals javascript knowledge recorded really fun wo not spoil go check i'll put link description comments jump tips kyle want kind briefly introduce yeah really quickly introduce like clement said web simplified channel that's channel teach mostly web development kind advice related topics well lifestyle kind things know like soft skills mostly i'm teaching web development really simplifying web making easy possible people understand awesome we're share 10 important tips way kind came separately came five tips we're gonna share first time first time i'm hearing kyle's tips first time he's hearing mine we'll see redundancy tried pick five kind like niche tips uh hopefully not pick ones clearly they're important not start us tip number one kyle yeah tip number one definitely going make sure understand relationship client server communicate learning web development kind not really realize whole client server dynamic completely separate one another communicating went know certain protocols understanding things like rest apis going really good understanding code running client code running server really important something people kind skip go straight javascript instead actually learning communication client server think that's really good one that's not one ones really good one think something tends click first time either work real company really build like full stack project that's really good one first tip purely related client side although help debug things sometimes server side basically well versed chrome dev tools chrome dev tools really powerful set tools uh lot advanced tools use chrome devtools things like see much memory website page using things like slow network requests really helpful also looking network requests seeing responses api giving server giving seeing parameters passing api call network request tab chrome dev tools super useful that's first tip well versed chrome dev tools mean amazing tip good tip actually included similar tip list make sure learn use dev tools not debugging sites going sites think cool interesting techniques figure actually yesterday someone discord server listing really cool image thing saw website confused worked intrigued went website opened dev tools kind played around figured css using actually changing things javascript make work not learning dev tools site also learning use dev tools figure cool things sites happen nice thing client-side code publicly available view dev tools learning use not site sites great tool yeah that's really good point like example one time exactly describing apple website i'm sure lot seen apple really cool kind uis display things like scroll see images kind change rotate interesting see actually like notice oh actually video file kind somehow run scroll um yeah great tip guess brings second tip second tip gonna wary edge cases happen like website user interactions website handle edge cases specifically i'm thinking two things number one error handling really want make sure handle possible errors lot possible errors web development code think see lot web developers especially they're starting make example api calls they'll use like promise right api call dot functionality not put anything dot catch happens there's error entire page go blank not show anything that's something always keep mind similarly oftentimes like get list array entities elements might want display page react know like map list render stuff people forget handle case array empty not list users display website not list whatever right want handle empty state show know page display something that's usable user that's awesome tip mean honestly find running time create happy path everything's working great obviously developing like always right thing never clicking wrong button wrong order like yep works ship everything breaks people not things way expect edge cases pop one thing kind recommend help catch edge cases testing write test code makes think edge cases way always guaranteed least think edge cases code writing likely going go back add code fix edge cases write different tests next tip one actually applied really anything life trying learn something teach anyone could teach rubber duck could teach us know stuffed animal could teach friends family anyone not matter try teach learning gonna make stick much not actually realize powerful started youtube channel lot teaching lot learning teach things realized actually going teaching things made really understand things work really deep level not understand things deep level really hard explain teach get enough skill understand something well enough start explaining teaching really going solidify mind make sure actually understand something opposed knowing write really base case actually really understand core works teach that's great tip think applies basically anything not even software engineering i've felt firsthand algo expert know teaching algorithms makes really understand fundamental level say probably take advice try teach someone like css flexbox css like layout know rules feel like always complain css actually sit hour teach someone flexbox works i'm pretty sure would suddenly like truly internalize remember great tip third tip uh one might kind obvious one others might not responsiveness days always want make sure website responsive especially mobile think people forget think sometimes like people disregard mobile they'll say okay website wo not used mobile not big priority right that's fair maybe lot screen sizes apart mobile right developing let's say macbook pro used looks good 13 inch screen might forgetting looks good 15 inch screen 12 inch screen 18 inch right not like resize window take account responsiveness might website looks amazing screen looks really bad really like janky sloppy screens even simple things like know navbar like overlapping spilling people's strength screens got handle stuff yeah 100 think media queries response really underrated even not go far like developing way mobile way large large screen sizes long something play around dev tools like change size screen stuff see happens website likely going run little edge cases stuff kind we're we're topic css fourth tip actually become decent not good css not become great not become amazing become good enough create things css without much struggle top learn basics design like one week design crash course kind thing i'm not talking become designer learn absolute basics going set apart almost every developer developers let's honest sites look terrible not really know css they're probably using something like bootstrap foundation build basic ui go little bit beyond learn css ten percent better everyone else learn design one percent better everyone else sites gonna look hundred times better really gonna set apart comes interviews comes actual resume different stuff really going make look like great candidate think that's great piece advice like hate css gets kyle completely point website css looks really bad also know css even little bit feel much empowered suddenly wo not person who's always like center div right able center div able put things aesthetically web page great tip tip number four um kind niche one comfortable mocking data specifically data api might give lot times least experience going developing front end web developer api either not entirely done it'll flux back end wo not responding expect respond it'll responding kind like partial data not want blocked front-end developer might sucks not full data mock data mock api responses sometimes simple going javascript code deading know hijacking like promise response api call response know making return object liking object looks like entity expecting got mocked data know copy hundred times need hundred users something like develop front end without needing fully fledged back end awesome tip even take step i'm creating applications almost always write html css like static version site first add implementation details kind thing like blocking site look like makes much easier write like actual integration interaction going work visual representation static version product looks like think mocking general whether like said api request actual ui really important final tip far important tips i've listed that's not skip basics many people start learn spend one week html spend two weeks css spend next like 18 years learning javascript immediately jump building projects right away skip basics html css javascript go straight building complex projects watching tutorials things spend time takes little longer going spend two weeks html going spend month css going spend like two months learning basics javascript going accelerate learning much instead getting stuck every time reach weird bug edge case that's not covered tutorial following going know exactly problem learned basics not not going know exactly issue really recommend learning basics makes much easier build whatever want instead always relying tutorials build want that's great tip think know ironically boring stuff like putting button page putting list page might seem boring trivial think kyle's right like able really seamlessly usually involves done fundamental level first it'll equip much better complex projects future final tip little bit actually kind related well-versed basics fundamentals server side think lot people end going front-end side web development side might not even full stack know might really focus front end kind forget back end issues constraints sometimes know they'll complain like api call that's returning list users i'll go example api not telling every user many questions they've completed algoexpert example giving example well maybe backend return number questions every user completed would query database every single user right maybe that's databases designed maybe that's not sub-optimal maybe ui little bit work understanding backend ca not simple example show sometimes back end complexity know back-end engineers sometimes not understand front-end engineers know struggles sometimes understand back-end engineers database constraints five tips looks like actually not much redundancy except chrome dev tools think tip added like lot uh lot value um feel like like jam-packed session tips like hopefully enjoyed uh 10 tips uh last words want share kyle yeah want say tip iceberg planning five tips probably hundreds tips could shared enjoyed video make sure definitely leave like let us know maybe there'll part two eventually not know ton fun thanks bringing yeah awesome uh i'll second think funny like go tips exercise coming tips like realize like really valuable think 10 tips really valuable lot could share thanks joining us yes not forget smash like button not subscribed channel subscribe follow kyle subscribe channel follow linkedin twitter enjoy short form written content instagram like pictures otherwise see next video what's everybody how's going video going putting javascript skills test that's right video i'm going giving seven question javascript quiz i've created seven questions wrote not questions test really weird javascript trivia kind like obscure implementation details javascript like not know something like know add empty object number gives string something weird like no instead created questions really assess things think pretty commonly used production level javascript kind stuff actually run day-to-day yeah hopefully it'll put knowledge skills test pretty difficult quiz depending level experience depending much attention give see know curveballs say least not want spoil anything yeah would encourage even remotely familiar javascript take quiz basically i'm going walk seven questions i'll give know three seconds pause video answer question know come answer end know paused video guess like 20 seconds i'll walk seven questions we'll go answers explain work suppose last thing say dive basically questions code look end console.log something multiple things task either tell guess code outputs console.logs perhaps determine there's actually bug code error going thrown that's let's dive quiz see many answers get correctly i'm going give seconds question pause screen answer question we'll dive let's jump question number one question number one take minutes seconds pause answer question going question number two take seconds pause question look give answer okay gonna question number three pause screen could answer question question number four might zoom little bit um see full code question number four we've got question number five pretty long one i'm going scroll slowly might want pause i'm going scroll part second part want pause question number six think zoom back question number six finally question number seven i'll zoom back i'll scroll little bit question number seven like first part end okay point watching right around time stamp video either decided not want take quiz want go straight answers walkthrough totally fine taken quiz eagerly waiting see answers let's go way back question number one go together question number one think probably easiest although not actually order order difficulty reason think pretty easy really tests knowledge understanding reduce function arrays think beginners beginners ever seen used reduce function they're trying sum array integers numbers that's typically use reduce function really reduce gathers like group elements array reduces one value right accumulates sort logic one value we're we've got array um objects objects know properties x reduces array objects single object map maps every x value every x property fubar baz b dot x corresponding value b dot dot reduce function takes beginning element empty object pass return know destructure empty object grab properties every iteration accumulator take b dot x property know individual object put b dot run node question one dot js see foo barbaz map respective value pretty straight forward know reduce works gotten one correct make sure keep track score okay let's move question number two question number two kind fun one um possible gotten error not know things work basically we've got array one array objects every object name property fubar baz we've got three arrays array two three four created basically based array one really tricky one opinion array 2 not array 3 array 4. array 3 look literally mapping array 1 new array object returning new object right new object destructuring object currently destructing example object object right meaning grabbing name property also adding position property index array three create new array going objects every object additional property current index array three way currently written not mutate array one array four that's there's little trick might fallen prey fact slicing array one we're making copy array one every element copy array one array four add position property thing trick slice making shallow copy not actually like recreating objects actually making copy array array carrying pointing objects example something like const equals name foo put array array 4 array 1 dot slice even though array 4 would different array compared array 1 would still exact value array one trick array four actually going mutate array one console.log array one actually look output exactly like array three array four two things array three every four array two trickier one array two create brand new array length array one fill array empty objects every object seemingly add name property based corresponding object array one add position would think okay like we're thing effectively array three right we're not mutating array two would incorrect reason new array not new array dot fill array value pass dot fill actually going exact value passed every single position array we're not creating new empty object every position array we're filling array exact empty object kind thing slice like kind logic empty object object.position equals idx object.name equals name we're mutating object we're like last index we're actually mutating object previous indices means array 2 we're going end array objects they're going look like baz name baz index position 2. let's actually run node question two see array one get mutated positions three four we'd expect mutation happened four finally array two like said bads position two objects they're like three pointers thing memory okay let's move make sure keep track got right let's go question number three question number three little bit tricky bunch promises main trick question number three not might think might think trying test know know objects like foo object um like return values promises seem objects seem mutated inside promises get mutated answer yes like instantiate create two objects two promises resolve objects one fancy set timeout meaning going resolve three seconds not really matter promise.all edit mutate two objects add plus algo expert plus systems expert way software engineer prepared coding interviews systems design interviews check company i'll go expert go algo expert dot io use promo code clem clem discover platform point first mutate time promise.all rather two promises resolve objects mutated guess hit console log bottom line 32 first we're going console log two objects mutated names get promise console.log two kind original objects mutated names constantly log foo bar values returned promise thing right exact object seemingly mutate fu bar algo expert sort boolean food.name.includes algo expert return two objects another dot problem there's already bug we're actually gonna break promise dot hit dot catch console.log error bug happens foo dot algo expert equals foo dot name dot includes reason there's bug like said beginning really need paying attention promise.all pass array promises right pass array promises return values gonna array not put array foo bar what's going actually happen code foo going entire response promise.all foo actually going array foo bar that's foo going look like bar going undefined see actually run right node question three there's delay three seconds foo algo expert bar's systems expert line 32 hit line 14 line 14 thing line 15 foo like said actual object sorry array response promise.all whereas bar undefined food.name.includes no no.name property array right array not dot name property undefined dot includes ca not dot includes undefined get get error hit cat that's kind tricky one kind annoying one i'm sure actually know promise.all returns array might not seen not returning array something i've actually faced real code base like back not using typescript algo expert using javascript not told error javascript ran issue remember super confused like what's going like promises seem correct missing brackets i'd forgotten basically add brackets right return array something always keep mind let clear terminal let's move question four okay question four interesting one something i've seen people make mistake pay attention got wrong basically candidate object bunch properties seems like candidate applying job something we've got one function get signed offer takes candidate two possibilities right candidate not looking job candidate not remote friendly properties return object error message error message candidate not meet requirements offer not signed return candidates object one conditions conditions true return object right no error offer signed information candidate that's console.log first glance seems pretty easy right okay get signed offer takes candidate candidate looking job looking job not not looking job remote friendly we're not going hit condition right we're not going hit we're going go we're going return object we're going call log no error null offer signed candidate seems like we're setting looking job false true we're grabbing rest candidate properties destructuring right re-adding object info we're grabbing stuff info except employed we're setting true false candidate signed offer they're employed yeah that's would expect returning right no that's not get reason looking job turns everything said correct except looking job actually still going true run code reason destructure object like overwrite properties inside might declared it'll overwrite looking job candidate object destruct candidate looking job we'll overwrite one whereas info correctly put employed true destruction candidate dot info employed false employed overwrite previous one candidate looking job we'll overwrite one run oh yeah edited really run node question four see looking job true whereas move one line right rerun looking job false something that's really important uh keep mind always want put properties typically easier avoid bugs put properties actually hard coding destructuring object put destruction object gonna avoid type bug often working example redux something keep mind okay that's four questions many questions far keep track question number five really long one question number five kind like previous one kind follow code figure path we're gonna going seems kind straightforward basically we've got um function get application eligibility we've got big data object object exists applications look actual code we're grabbing bunch know variables declaring variables constants data object depending condition call get application eligibility function otherwise console.log let's see looking job data object true okay company.info.humanresourcesinfo.has job openings true well condition seems met we're going call function person id age person company id okay values data object get application eligibility follow code age smaller 18 no age 26 okay we're going skip existing application company id 7182 right dot includes candidate id 517 517 array no not we're not going hit line presumably would hit candidate apply that's code tells us follow right little bit complicated that's end there's bug code said we're gonna get incorrect bug we're gonna flat error bug company.info way declare constants we're grabbing id person object naming person id we're grabbing age grabbing company id id company object naming company grabbing looking job we're not actually grabbing company we're notation grabbing id property company object calling company id we're not grabbing company run node question five see company not defined would also declare company run run code would work candidate apply something know not going encounter time work kind like nested objects stuff like might actually encounter might find destructure big object like might forget know declare certain constant yeah working not typescript compiler not tell immediately like hey know typescript um stuff not tell immediately like hey got error gonna bug bad bug okay question number five let's move question number six question number six kind silly one annoying one really one trick um opinion first follow kind complicated convoluted logic following know closely follow correctly there's one trick first part foo part i'll dive second guess let's cover bar first bar takes array number one concatenate array number two meaning merges two arrays know concat works creates brand new array values array one array two checks equality value value another array brand new array destructures values array one array two basically i'm testing whether know know two identical arrays not actually pointing thing memory false false true bar could true remember correctly not true reducing first array we're multiplying values starting accumulator value one multiply zero array one entire thing going equal zero hand array two add numbers array two zeros we're adding bunch zeros also start one going equal one one not equal zero false false bar false false foo lot probably said false foo probably know walked code double check calculations concluded yeah false not false would said false okay foo equals array one structured we're basically copying array one filter array one grab elements array one um mod two equal one meaning odd numbers right divide two remainder one basically i'll write would seven fifteen one 7 would array 1 filter sort array presumably would 1 7 7 15. slice 0 2 2 excluded basically grab first two elements one seven map elements plus five one plus five six seven plus five twelve right check sum dot sum like element array satisfy condition element greater 15 6 not greater 15 12 not greater 15 presumably said false right no no like said objectively true well error dot sort see javascript javascript fun like dot sort default not pass anything we'll first convert values strings it'll sort strings lexicographically meaning number 15 15 like comes number seven number two comes seven one lexicographically like unicode value whatever comes two comes seven dot sort array actually get um i'm pretty sure get one fifteen seven seven get slice take first two values get one fifteen not one seven add five fifteen get twenty twenty greater fifteen got one value that's greater fifteen foo true node question um question six see true false would fix well would pass comparator function sort function b two elements sort like sorting comparison return minus b look mozilla docs see like return value comparator function determine sort order minus b run get false excuse get false actually sorted array logic described ensues that's question number six like said kind annoying one like main trick dot sort maybe got caught things maybe thing array comparison caught reduce know starting value really tricky one dot sort know uh fallen prey sometimes know production code like typescript not save right dot sort without comparative function also correct something really know know run bug bang head wall figure okay last not least question number seven question number seven kind follows theme we've uh throughout quiz lot like know uh copies objects arrays whether mutating array object whatever overwriting things basically we've got create person function takes name location interests first create person basically referencing default person object seems like kind know default structure person code destructure object name actually passed function not like undefined set person's name effectively effectively overwrite unknown thing location thing interest return person we've got three methods set name takes person name set location person location add interest person interest overwrite name overwrite location push interest list interests person okay create four persons yuan elon musk jeff bezos bill gates mark zuckerberg mark zuckerberg mark zuckerberg see passed undefined right add interest set names set locations basically naively read code would expect eventually elon interests know tesla space renewable energy jeff bezos moon amazon space renewable energy know blue origin that's he's interested space bill gates microsoft renewable energy medicine he's earth last person indeed mark zuckerberg earth likes facebook medicine console.log see actually incorrect see think error um yeah jeff bezos mark zuckerberg like duplicated interests question seven yeah see jeff bezos amazon space renewable energy energy facebook medicine mark zuckerberg things jeff bezos destructure object destruction always shallow copy thing like dot slice example array we're destructing properties we're making shallow copy interests array not interest create person jeff bezos mark zuckerberg passed undefined interest keep array interests person might add undefined interests add interest naively pushing interest array means know duplicated interests know um conflicting interests that's really not good know kind elementary mistake really bad one one sometimes know it'll escape forget um really not want forget really cause like nasty bugs code base kind thing like typescript not save either none particularly like incorrect um often case something like default structure something like something like line eight gotta careful like would probably wanna something like know interests reset empty array let's rerun suddenly go jeff bezos mark not conflicting interests yeah question number seven um kind tricky one whole shallow copying hopefully um know got right not hopefully learned something i'm curious quiz know let know comments let everybody know uh it'll keep accountable score many questions seven get correct um ones get wrong um think said beginning get know couple questions even lot wrong not feel bad right great way like learn questions rather learn job know real production like bug uh yeah hopefully enjoyed video kind fun making quiz actually like relatively hard make come like seemingly non-convoluted good questions hopefully agree questions not super obscure like trivia they're actually know legit javascript yeah enjoy quiz not forget smash like button youtube algorithm comment score like said subscribe channel not already follow linkedin twitter enjoy short form written content instagram like pictures otherwise see next video okay purple apple purple apple let's see reversing linked list works soon eat apple purple apple snake get reversed could go opposite direction reversing linked list worked real production great apple wait what's everybody how's going video i'm gonna building snake game scratch javascript react entertainment think gonna really exciting what's gonna make particularly exciting fact think i'm gonna use linked list might even reversing linked list build project swear gonna stay tuned yeah think gonna fun project lately feel like coding i've coding work i've algorithms company algo expert building ui algo expert way software engineer preparing coding interviews systems design interviews check company i'll go expert go algoexpert.io use promo code clem clem discount platform yeah feel like i've coding work not really coding fun project think gonna pretty fun code not know i've kind obsessed building snake game past weeks think might seen like video online twitter post online snake game i've thinking know going represent snake code board code really excited also think going really good beginner medium project anybody who's web development see we're going build entirely javascript react kind going like tutorial i'm kind going know show code walk although also speed run code github look fork copy paste whatever want let's jump project let's fun coding guess first thing show we're building case not familiar snake game found random version snake game online i'll play right describe basically snake game snake 2d board usually see kind outlines squares board guess not goal game control snake eat food kind randomly appears screen little like gear icon flower icon whenever eat food snake gets bigger oops like lost i'll go faster they've got couple different speeds um basically like ever hit wall ever hit like tail example body lose goal game get know high score possible snake grows really really big time goes um that's going game that's we're building let kill one second i'll eat see kind like looped ate body died yeah that's we're building pure javascript pure react building well first used something called create react app npm package whatever basically awesome tool think need npm installed actually use run one command installs everything need create react app sets directory project basically react everything know installed everything updates automatically save see browser i'll put link create react app page description go basically follow instructions set everything vs code project i've deleted files created not really need like test files things like basically we've got app component main uh app file renders board component i've created see empty component code going go not think i'm going need components we'll see i've got board css file that's going css file board guess there's also app.css file like code see screen like app um background know like color background background color put board something like know foo bar appear middle go foobar last couple things show also pre-created utils file copy pasted function generate random number interval javascript got stack overflow reason know already we're going need sort random number generation try figure food pops board uh apart not think i'm gonna needing know google stack overflow we'll see um thing knew needed know preemptively yeah that's really i'm gonna close um files they've created know like app index.js renders app we're going working board file uh last thing guess i'll show notes file created text file notes like think we're going building project different components first we're going want create board think we're going represent matrix know 2d array two-dimensional array javascript pretty simple we're going want create snake think we're going using singly linked list snake that's envisioned we're going handle know growing snake it'll like adding node linked list um think we're going add know something fun know randomly food make snake reverse direction i've seen versions game like know every food eat like poison something instead making snake grow reverses direction that's think we're gonna use legitimately reversing linked list we'll see actually works course styles we're gonna handle actual movement snake automatic like snake moves every like second half second whatever key presses like change direction uh consuming food guess making food like appear randomly handling death go bounds know hit border like eat um score although maybe wo not we'll see guess that's like counter yeah handling starting game resetting game to-do's think able get like couple hours without google stack overflow see uh let's begin creating board i'm going go ahead create i'll see done okay think i've got board created pretty simple i've done lot past pathfinding visualizer project also 2d grid kind know basically created board variable um react going like state variable case know need access easily update something um basically creates new two-dimensional array i've got constant um size array right we're like 10 10 board guess know 100 cells uh yeah that's that's really iterate board map know every row element every row map every cell element i've got three classes board row cell cells styles right they're 50 pixels might little bit big uh we'll see i've got outline also put outline board um otherwise like not outline board reason outer outline um like not thick enough guess like inner outlines cells kind overlap whatever not want go fancy i'm putting outline board looks like right i'm gonna go ahead already create styles snake cells food cells already created i'm going create kind internal representation snake okay snake cell gonna look like simple kind green color uh basically added class know snake cell food cell gave background color made know class name cell element right um there's going sort condition determines whether snake cell maybe know food cell case it'll red maybe i'll choose like less bright red um cell like put false false it'll back normal okay snake representation code think i'm gonna go singly linked list every cell body part snake guess going linked list node points next part snake remember game like snake moves right body know go next like head pretty easy know we'll reference head figure next cell head needs go based direction snake going every node needs go every part snake's body needs know go next think linked list really easy like every node become equal next pointer something like need access tail think tail like want reversal tail become head um think want access tail i'll keep reference tail maybe wo not need actually yeah let's see works i'll try create classes linked list nodes uh i'll let know goes okay yeah think kind mind like i've got singly linked list class class holds references head tail linked list not know we'll actually need tail um create singly linked list pass value creates first node linked list going head tail linked list node class super simple got like value dot next pointer need figure like actually know cell snake let's say snake know middle array need either array like inside inside like value cell array right needs maybe um actual node snake like needs hold need sort set hash table points like whether not um snake particular cell let play around i'll show come know five ten minutes i've moved board uh generation function create board function takes board size honest not think i'm using let replace two numbers board size creates two-dimensional array like thing fills two-dimensional array counter every cell board unique number starts one goes way actually render counter cell value cell value see know number every cell number um that's going i'm going use know cell effectively snake cell food cell something else i've got javascript set sets kind like hash tables um unique values access constant time i've got set going hold numbers numbers going snake body right every cell snake body going going number snake cells set starts number 44. picked number 44 usually like play game snake um know start remember like kind middle guess not necessarily middle i'm gonna go middle um snake gonna start always cell 44 um yeah that's really guess like um code react code says like class cell cell snake cells cell value we're also add snake cell class snake cell class gives color green background color green also created snake right i'm not actually using snake uh new singly linked list passed number 44 going value gets passed node i'm not sure i'm actually going need value snake cells figure like every snake cell know currently um board think that's think i'm going i'm going try making maybe handle like automatic movement maybe i'm going make like snake immediately start moving right left let's go right first um see kind like update number snake kind figure means i'm also going need directions i'm probably going create uh equivalent like typescript enum directions like right right left kind figure i'm going code i'll get back hopefully snake moves right um not gonna controlling yet wanna see kind like [music] move okay i'm right think sort bug clearly there's like snake body that's staying um apart like movement starting work i'll walk code kind like remove bug figure bug maybe clean bit okay weird bug code not really understand happening know what's going basically like reference snake cells keep even though updated um causing bug like original cell always registered snake cell trying figure seems like sort like react bug kind questioning knowledge react right we'll see figure [music] okay bug clearly like something i'm i'm messing way set intervals work way references work added button i've got like tiny button click call move snake button um function button move snake function i've created move snake correctly see like correctly set interval references seem never get updated i'm going try figure [music] okay i'm growing frustrated i'm still not sure set interval causing like references snake cells not update properly i'm going right i'm going move forward try like kind rest game little bit manual button click move snake works right get progress manual movement i'll try go back automatic movement make work sometimes that's got really stuck something kind frustrating not really know stuck move something else come back pair fresh eyes okay got directions move updating directions arrow keys basically right know move manually right snake going press arrow key move manually i'm going press right arrow key i'll go right left i'll go left etc way simple used add event uh listener window apparently use key not key press register arrow keys key press arrow keys not registering javascript go figure yeah simple get new direction function get direction key pass event key arrow return error right return right oh way guess forgot told direction kind hash table supposed look like typescript enum right left that's return empty string key not one four arrow keys check know valid direction meaning not empty string imagine user might type know key not want know update direction incorrectly um not want update sort like undefined null value yeah said direct direction new direction voila i'm still kind frustrated not figured automatic movement not want stay stuck long i'm going i'm going um food we're going random food position uh we're gonna allow snake eat food i'll figure know snake goes food cell probably wanna know randomly generate new cell food kind figure maybe uh not make snake grow yet i'll make snake consume food move food around looks like got food consumption uh mostly done least like know consuming food making food appear elsewhere look i'll i'll move snake manually press arrow keys press button see go oops oh god manual moving annoying go apple eats whoops keep pressing wrong keys uh apple goes elsewhere see random position okay need handle like happens i'm bounds um yeah way pretty simple imported random int interval function utils uh move snake not walked moving snake logic yet there's something kind broken basically figure head snake right get next uh head coordinates coordinates next head snake would moving pretty simple function like based direction current row column snake head stored linked list uh node value like cell class um compute know get figure coordinates need get next row column say next head value right value board remember unique number food cell i've created state variable food cell started number 48 food always starts next head value head next head would food handle food consumption handle food consumption pretty simple function going effectively update next food going that's right that's we'll also handle growth snake that's right handles next food effectively replaces current food handles next food figure next food use random function pick random number one smallest number cells created board started one maximum cell possible cell value going know board size multiplied board size pretty naively think practice going fine wild true loop keep generating random numbers found one find one not current food cell not current snake cell fine like time complexity we're dealing like 100 cells um even like 90 cells well guess okay 90 cells snake maybe maybe i'll like change snake gets bigger bigger maybe know like five percent chance getting right number maybe bad um unused number fine right odds getting unused uh know number food cell pretty high let take look notes i've done board mark x i've done kind snake not done snake growth not done direction reversal i've done styles right done styles i've done key presses um not quite handled movements i've handled food consumption not snake growth um handle maybe death maybe handle um score score pretty easy i'll handle score i'll handle um death i'll handle game start game reset [music] okay tried cleaning code little bit renaming stuff removing code not really need bug not frustration coding [music] oh god literally going crazy wondering code suddenly not working like working perfectly fine rereading working realized keep calling handle game bug keep calling handle game keep resetting game every movement ah 20 minutes bug bounds function call see handle know game call zero instead call less zero that's bug okay i've got kind simple game mechanism die like touch sounds really weird snake eats go bounds go bounds resets board resets score i'll probably make little bit polished actually like see score end see like know big snake sounds awkward uh get idea right i'm gonna i'm gonna keep manual movement thing i'm gonna try uh grow snake we're gonna see manually i'm gonna uh move forward try fix bug let's dive first let get coffee refill i'm coffee yes redbull red bull sponsor ah okay i'm realizing snake movement pretty complicated little bit complicated linked list comes play multiple cells constitute body snake think i'm gonna even handle making snake grow i'm gonna handle like making snake move one square i'm gonna default snake size like three four play around might make board little bit bigger slightly smaller cell sizes okay looks like another bug like starts guess cell 48 reason move manually goes random place i'm not really sure um goes back top like goes loop big square i'm going look that's happening ca not hard code row column value like hard coding cell value snake begin always 44 also hard coding row columns kind like messes everything worked 10 10 board i'm gonna fix okay i've handled no matter board size um snake food cells positioned correctly beginning i'm gonna clean code starting look little bit messy i'm gonna keep going right wanna say wanna make snake size three four start uh kind handle movement snake size three four let's see actually i'm going i'm going make snake grow manually button i'm going press button that's going keep adding like nodes snake guess i'll probably able reuse logic later need actually food consumption that's i'm going go guess creating like new linked list nodes surprisingly like difficult even want like start know length three something way i'm think gonna make little bit sense [music] okay lot code i'll show i've got far grow snake manually pressing button grows back adds tail linked list i'll show second code basically update tail linked list create new node set new tail linked list new node update pointer previous tail that's way confirms fact indeed need tail snake reference head tail grow grow back way far um grow snake keeps going back ever point snake gonna like ca not grow back reach border gonna handle like find another direction grow decided keep things simple like not anything right spam button not gonna grow back anymore um like space frees bit complicated try find like free cell could imagine scenarios like snake wrapped around way no free cells would grow not want handle basically like ca not grow one direction back um know not gonna grow ca not see right way works like snake kind curved grow direction opposite tail pointing guess let show code really quickly there's lot stuff i've got gross snake function defined right gross snake get growth node coordinates row column growth node node i'm add function get growth node pass tail direction first get direction next node tail way know tail tail's next node like right left based i'm going grow opposite direction right snake curved tail like even head entire body going right let's say tail curved way tail going left still want get opposite direction handle case like um know one node no next node that's kind handle code i'm not gonna walk guess look github want um growth direction get opposite direction tails next node get current tail coordinates get um growth node coordinates return um create new node new tail right create new node set current tail current snake tail keep reference update snake.tail new tail snag.tail.next points current tail kept reference way tail new tail new node added snake points old tail snake grows like seems working right handle actually moving snickers right press move manually oh wait whoa working working feel like not handle um not sure entire body moving try look code see working magically that's awesome okay i'll i'm gonna look code i'll let know what's going okay know moving seamlessly even multiple nodes earlier done find new head snake right would remove tail would cut tail like code right obviously conceptually moving snake code i'm adding new head slicing tail that's i'm know say like um snake.tail equals snag.tail.next remove delete uh snag.tail.value.cell set snake cells that's like seamlessly removes um body move see like refresh grow snake move creating new head removing old tail move creates new head removes old tail looks like snake moving need handle like growing snake kind breaks think need handle like move go oh yeah okay okay something broke kind works uh annoying broke like feel like not broken go boom right okay there's definitely something quirks need figure um part kind working i'm gonna dive let's see figure [music] okay seem gotten work needed think that's causing like bugs needed make sure um current head like move create new head needed make sure current head points new head grabbed reference current head currenthead.next equals new head i've put new head snake kind thing tail like tail put new tails dot next point current tail like previous tail right thing head want current head point new head eventually like way linked list working right eventually tail snake reach current head move think that's bugging right like bugging like look remove actually let confirm uh let's remove currenthead.next that's that's really fixes grow snake bunch right move manually like four times wait let let one two three boom boom boom break see breaks three movements suddenly one next pointers incorrect three movements one two three one two three third fourth movement broken fixes way directions right let's say one two three go one two go one see fourth movement broken gotta keep updating next pointers linked lists work see algorithms useful data structures useful okay growing works nice let's see handle actual uh growth snake without manual growth let's see handle eat food right i'm not fully handling let's get working okay think mostly working like grows go food um way went prior logic look working working super well need actual automatic movements logic similar basically like create new head i'm moving snake right new head logic see i've consumed food logic moved see i've consumed food not handle food consumption like know move find new position food move right simple function also call growth snake function one press manually broke broke oh know broke um i'm passing new sakes snake cells remember we're moving head right like re-update react snake cells calling set say snake cells function right um bugs happening gross snake also call function set snake cells um updating react state twice row like two different things weird kind async i'm i'm i'm passing new snake cells i've already created new head new deleted tail um i've consumed food grow snake function use new snake cells reference rather like relying previous snake cells makes sense otherwise not consumed food update snake cells i'm going remove guess grow manual grow button i'm going try figure bug automatic movement think need except oh guess reversing linked list probably reverse linked list maybe i'll uh i'll try figure bug first i'll reversing linked list end fun trying debug whole like bug movement not working automatically turns set interval method making declarative work react uh hooks found article think written dan abramov guy created um react who's like one big developers react i'm not sure either way um copied code uh use interval little bit fancy way use set interval make declarative react hooks know read leisure utils use use interval 150 millisecond interval call move snake function trying use effect save actually works refresh actually like moves automatically working snake game think i'm gonna spend last minutes uh whole like reversal direction snake i'm probably gonna make like new food gets created not know 20 chance something uh reversed opposite direction lost uh reverse opposite direction we're literally going reverse linked list we'll see actually works wanted last thing i'm going kind elegantly handle starting game ending game know not like super janky think i'm probably gonna call i've working quite let's get [music] okay made uh 20 chance consume food find new food location i'm gonna make new food location one reverse direction right thing next food reverse direction math.random less 0.2 20 chance uh one reverses direction color going purple think way i'm going handle handle food consumption i'm going say hey right food reverse direction we're going call method named reverse snake literally going reverse length list think that's need we're still know setting snake cells set um yeah reverse snake function think i'm going copy paste reverse linked list method algo expert great algo expert plug user problem code clamp clem discount platform i'm going i'm going add couple lines handle fact length list class excuse unlike one algo expert algo expert nodes i'm actually using wrapper class access head tail i'm gonna kind like invert that's let's go get code algo expert copy paste okay reverse linked list code copied algo expert really think going super easy going awesome reverse snake let's define right const reverse snake equals like method reverse linked list i'm actually going put utils well right export uh function reverse linked list takes head singly linked list i'm going pass head head node thing one algo expert node dot next value uh reverse link list going import we'll put middle alphabetical order reverse length list reverse snake okay think i'm going call reverse link list snake dot head think that's need right we're gonna um snake const snake head equals snake dot head we'll snake dot head equals snake dot tail we'll snake dot tail equals snake head right we're swapping two variables two pointers believe need oh need reverse direction i'm going um set direction okay actually tricky set direction need update direction not want going direction want going not opposite direction we're currently going going opposite direction tail right remember thing um like growing growing snake right grow snake grow opposite direction tail i'm gonna tiny bit fancy logic give one second basically copied code growth logic get direction tail kind coming um i'm setting direction right reversing linked list thing think might like might bugs might need handle like tail wall something uh honest like not want not want think right not want handle not think worth kind spending time leave exercise viewer whoever wants like pick project listen i'm excited see reversing linked list works i'm going super happy let's test right game okay game starts right immediately not done polish okay right let's grow let's wait get purple apple think purple apple logic works okay i'm bad snake okay okay okay let's wait okay purple apple purple apple let's see reversing linked list works soon eat apple purple apple snake get reversed could go opposite direction reversing linked list worked real production great apple wait not see happened what'd okay let let restart guess sort bug not think ate right not see ate okay let's restart saying reversing linked list worked real production grade application i'm bad game okay let grow oh god okay let restart come okay ready ready ready gonna get reversed wait let give bit space let's go ahead right like look oh not not work well body still wait gonna second snake wait what's happening okay i'm probably not updating certain pointer [music] oh know know know reason not working algo expert head linked list i'm considering tale see important actually like lesson coding interviews production always think exactly naming head tail like calling tail called head makes sense head snake what's beginning that's not even realize moved reverse length list top i'm i'm reversing snake dot i'm passing snake dot tail actual head linked list working makes sense yes perfectly fine uh board i'm not gonna polish i'm gonna fix reversing right made reverse time okay think snake game working sort final version guess let remove button move manually button final sort unpolished version ca not spend much time game see 30 chance food going purple means direction reversed make sure account eat yeah otherwise snake game working change speed um code interval would probably something want add maybe like speed slider whoa got reversed okay gonna get reversed okay reversed we're gonna get reversed nice snake game oh no messed um couple bugs one bug uh right not make tried bug uh going opposite direction right like go left right yeah see killed um that's not supposed happen leave exercise viewer fix otherwise code like said github would encourage pull fork copy paste whatever want try build version snake game quite fun um let's see high score yeah hopefully guys enjoyed project uh ended taking like died ended taking like five hours um lot fun building think great project show know recruiters engineers know play host easily github go play yeah fun project teaches lot react vanilla javascript actually decent amount code like wrote much code write know 300 lines react utils file little bit css little css yeah fun around not forget smash like button learned something found entertaining follow linkedin twitter enjoy short form written content instagram like pictures otherwise see next video what's everybody how's going video want three things first want talk various types programmers exist second want invite identify perhaps even co-workers teammates types programmers i'll also tell type programmer think thirdly want tell think important exercise exercise try know types programmers co-workers we'll talk video without ado let's jump suppose say one thing jump none types programmers really set stone rules anything they're kind like stereotypes think they're stereotypes based reality like identified different types programmers four types specifically based experience know working google facebook saw bunch companies even experience working company smaller company i'll go expert way note preparing coding interviews systems design interviews check company i'll go expert go algo expert.io use promo code clem clem kind platform okay let's jump first type programmer exists type programmer soon faced sort bug challenge code jump immediately stack overflow kidding that's us okay seriously first type programmer like call coding machine funny thing term coding machine actually used legitimately facebook sort unofficial title might imagine refers type programmer pumps ton code pump code know way faster programmers would also extend really programmer cares much pure coding pure unadulterated coding rather anything else type programmer not really care type product they're working even team they're working care able code faced technically complex problems challenges care maybe dev environment they're working everything optimized tend work vim emacs tend really not like meetings know us not like meetings especially not like meetings want coding first type programmer second type programmer like call product oriented programmer think sort opposite coding machine type programmer cares deeply product they're working thing they're building type programmer unhappy they're wrong product example people not want working social media company social media product really feel passionately working types products similarly people really not want work enterprise product not want work something that's b2b want work something consumers including maybe actually use really care contrast coding machine might not care whether they're working let's say internal tool company they're working whether they're working youtube youtube front page coding machine not really care product oriented person product oriented programmer tends actually enjoy going meetings like part decision making product design second type programmer tends really take pride outcome output work rather work makes sense third type programmer like call domain expert domain specialist one little bit nuanced lives kind product oriented software engineer programmer coding machine sense someone really passionate product they're working might actually end coding machine they're working domain specialty typically something niche specialized canonical example like give programmer really specialized particular front-end framework example someone really specialized let's say react point want work react development team either know facebook like actual react development team maybe want work know company that's not facebook happens use react specifically want work good working maybe like internal framework wrapper around react know internal front-end api facilitates usage react rest engineering team that's specialized software engineer programmer finally fourth type programmer like call process oriented programmer type programmer deeply cares rigid rigorous robust three r's uh framework process development team care everything planned everybody team know everybody else working given time set rules code reviews sent they're reviewed they're approved care consistent style guidelines clean readable code care rigorous tests place rules tests done they're written many tests feature type programmer cares much things right way speak care much things done outcome work work care process work four types programmers i've personally identified course i'm sure might thinking right well kind feels like either people seen around fit two even three types yes like said not sort hard fast rule might fit couple types even three fact could even add fifth type programmer i'll call jack trades person who's legitimately little bit everything tell identify would say probably either somewhere jack trades mix minus domain expert probably core would say product oriented software engineer software engineer programmer deeply care i'm working i'm gonna build uh take part building give example ever go back work tech company not company i'll go expert unlike uh first job google not really choice google offer know really wanted happy kind sucked even though worked product google cloud platform not particularly passionate know not thing really wanted build google cloud platform go back company would definitely picky would definitely want work something truly brings excitement stark contrast one really good friends co-workers worked google who's team google cloud platform probably coding machine type person truly not care worked not care product not care feature implementing cared code not go meetings really cool tech stack work nice internal tools going uninterrupted able pump ton code that's wanted turns coding machine product oriented software engineer worked really well favors favorites complemented well brings final point wanted touch video try figure type programmer type programmer co-workers not let's talk second not get assigned work responsibilities clash type programmer best going less productive less happy worst going unproductive unhappy vein reason want know types programmers co-workers said co-worker google complemented well complement co-workers complement super well know types programmers know co-worker coding machine someone who's much product oriented maybe take meeting load maybe stuff kind uh know bores like technical work not really want going complement really well let's say engineering manager maybe maybe manager watching got team software engineers know types engineers going able cater assign work going make happy going make thrive going make team thrive product thrive company thrive right important know type programmer types programmers co-workers that's that's i've got i'm curious think first think missed major type programmer let know let know type programmer let know happen work dream team speak little bit everything know fact started algo expert co-founder antoine fit really well complimentary thing going kind domain expert everything infrastructure kubernetes docker really important really needed started algo expert build code execution engine get things running whereas really liked product stuff know rights kind coding machines know front end infrastructure kind worked really well us let know think comments not forget smash like button enjoyed video subscribe channel not already follow linkedin

difficult not even difficult parts programming like back engineering machine learning algorithms data structures i've worked front end throughout entire software engineering career feel pretty well equipped talk i've done i've identified narrowed four primary things make front-end development difficult want talk video without ado let's jump smash like button that's delicately made friend engineers gently tap little thumbs button tapped okay let's jump first thing first thing makes friend development difficult fact front end engineer know lot different languages speak i'm putting languages quotes they're not exactly programming languages let explain first course got javascript javascript kind bread butter friends need know javascript got html css course not really programming languages languages nonetheless know they've got unique syntax rules need know really well able anything top days front-end developer know least one modern-day front-end framework like react angular review ever worked front-end framework like react know basically like learning new language got new syntax new rules new ways writing things things accomplishing things need learn top frontend frameworks introduce layer top html learn working react going working jsx html that's another set rules know top like front-end frameworks tend updated every year like remember last year relearn react not entirely little bit brand new react syntax know use state use effect front developer know i'm talking not know brand new like revamp way react works point there's lot stuff know front engineer lot syntax lot rules learn second thing makes front end development difficult days products services going least one part ui user interface complex whether sort live feed events need updated immediately like example twitter linkedin feed posts get updated time sort dashboard ton entries lot actions performed lot uis going complex ui complex naturally prone bugs prone performance issues like legitimate lag ui prone messy code front engineer who's developed complex ui tell done faced something really complex sometimes kind throw whatever code makes work codes ends spaghetti code makes really hard maintain add stuff not good top complex uis uis lot stuff going often especially need look good right need look especially good rather much stuff going not want confusing want aesthetically pleasing makes really difficult actually felt first hand last weeks i've developing feature algo expert company way preparing coding interviews systems design interviews check company i'll go expert go algo expert.io use promo code clem clem discount platform new feature dashboard recruiters tech companies want access qualified users algo expert unlocked algo expert certificate dashboard really complex basically recruiters needed able see candidates algo expert information table needed able expand rows table see information needed able edit things candidates know filter skills know name search name filter region things like that's really difficult felt things know performance issues bugs messy code refactor code making look really pretty first dashboard kind looked okay not great move ton stuff around know lot help front engineer algo expert point complicated feature therefore difficult time building third thing makes friend development difficult fact nature user interfaces going interacting sort api backend meaning going asynchronous interactions send request api backend wait response asynchronous interaction not difficult actually fairly straightforward start get difficult got multiple api requests issued waited got ui going perform rather behave differently depending different api requests respond sort conjunction one another right sometimes got different combinations uis ui behaviors depending combinations responses example oh user not purchased product one api call signed beta another product another api call want they're not signed beta they're signed alpha want purchased product want completely ignore beta alpha i'm kind spitballing get idea could lot different things happen api requests really difficult code handle also might parts ui like example button page depends api response example maybe going button that's disabled based response api rest page everything except button not depend api call well want block entire page loading api call affects button probably not that's not going best know user experience going want make button depend api call well look like know button not show button show sort loading indicator know store data api call responds like store sort uh know front-end state something not going need later ui page gets visited often right going want store state point lot complexity arise asynchronicity asynchronicity basically synonymous front-end development fourth final thing makes friend development difficult one probably favorite one one think people take granted not realize listen carefully difference decent ui user interface great ui rather difference great ui excellent ui insane amount work words go great ui excellent one ui makes user think wow really good website ui makes user think wow one best websites i've ever seen really want come back really enjoy using difference take lot time effort lot diminishing returns sense go great excellent takes much time thing diminishing returns oftentimes still worth give couple examples know might take lot work might really get final polish i'll give example that's related pure styling one that's related javascript asynchronicity styling example lot things uis like buttons drop-down menus whatever movements part know either change colors go left right implementing things changes pretty simple want make look really nice might want add animations example might want add fade fade animations colors ease ease animations movements left right animations might look really really nice they've got little bit complexity like cubic bezier animation thing kind speeds slows end right animations take lot time animations done improperly add bugs jank not compatible certain browsers difficult time consuming javascript asynchronous side got error handling easy develop ui example form page forget handle bunch potential errors arise interacting ui whether validation errors like field put value put field incorrect api errors know submit api returns sort error handle network errors not get response api whatever reason easy forget not handle say oh yeah users not going encounter except five ten percent users encounter errors going really really bad time elegantly handling errors way makes sense sometimes displaying text user sometimes displaying entire new user interface flow user takes lot time lot effort difficult wraps four things i've identified primary difficulties front end development realize i've left things briefly hinted like example know cross browser compatibility issues mobile responsiveness also really complicated things front development four things mentioned important ones think let know thought comments hope found insightful agree disagree not forget smash like button enjoyed video like said little button made friend engineers tap subscribe channel not already otherwise follow linkedin twitter enjoy short form content instagram like pictures see next video\n"
