ca not google things podcasts like audio video formats no text googling like quote podcast not usually give result knew really good machine learning libraries python turn speech text thought actually wrote script turns every joe rogan podcast episode ever text way simply control f long ass text file find episode quote i'm looking got work little know would turn like fully fledged google joe rogan first part fairly simple task first needed download every joe rogan podcast episode youtube using little web scraping selenium combined youtube dl however joe rogan moved spotify found he's actually removed full prior episodes main channel kind sucks also channel called jreclipse posts lots shorter videos every podcast proof concept scraped website essentially jreclips youtube channel downloaded wav files different clips next found python library called speech recognition used turn audio text accepts wave files works wav files needed saved text simple json file that's almost uh actually 5 395 videos channel jre clips channel needed translated text took 30 seconds per video would still take 44 hours go videos essentially left computer running 11 days get okay running past 11 days long time try get episodes transcribed long-ass json file 59 hundred something videos transcribed computer's running non-stop trying get work let's try see actually like kind wanted let's control f thing let's see many times said ufos 369 said quite lot okay realized two things first lot fun seeing many times he's actually said different like weird words secondly searching json file not best user experience okay last night not really able fall asleep came idea thought it'd kind funny turn thing like google joe rogan could like search different things joe rogan podcast morning spent little bit time trying come like would funny name site wanted come something that's like combination google joe rogan uh searched couple different things tried find one actually available domain website came name go rogan like google like gorogen.com actually available bought guess we're making like really cheap knockoff version google like joe rogan google yeah first thing figure like best way actually first part actually figuring would host website got contact friends hostinger asked wanted part project thank hosting sponsoring project hosting site taken care next thing needed create database using postgresql port data json file postgres database needed create website using flask python could used query database meant become expert html css embarrassment not actually know not worry i've completely mastered

[music] right today we're going take look new dream desk setup 2021 stick around chance win keyboard mouse monitor let's go okay let's start ground actual desk that's supporting setup two meter long piece oak bought local wood shop stained sanded two times that's underneath desk two oddball legs put desk piece wood something might change future like standing legs legs go height monitors two 27 inch 1080p curved samsung monitors like go 1080p since they're quite cheap today i'm not picky extra bit sharpness 4k monitor could bring main purpose extra screen allow things use every hour less not know well argument actually holds that's feeling two monitors versus one massive monitor monitor stand arms max gaming monitor stand not know universal brand name i've seen people use design probably not exclusive sweden least trying find suggest looking description put links everything see yeah not much say wanted something minimal could handle two monitors computer that's powering setup i'm currently using 2020 dell xps 15 i'm running dual boot windows linux x ubuntu rarely use windows partition need case edit videos photos i'll building dedicated pc setup sometime near future subscribe want see also let know think build next keyboard got sent back not best really like color scheme feel issues right buttons not working linux setup could also either way looks good that's matters mouse chose go vertical mouse logitech something friend mine suggested shout philip not really watch videos anyway idea keeps wrists neutral position better wrist cause less overuse injuries least that's idea underneath mouse makeshift mouse pad actually placemat got random furniture shop sweden works really well actually chance win keyboard mouse one monitors thanks today's video sponsor x team actually wanted collaborate video order give away part desk setup really cool think stick around i'll let know enter win x-team community remote developers help companies scale development teams join x-team gain access job offers working long-term projects companies like riot games fox coin base get 2 500 per year use towards activities gear help stay energized always growing they're genuinely really cool company wanted create giveaway personal favorite monitor keyboard mouse participate contest need write comment hashtag xteamlife they'll choose random winner video comments contest run week alright get accessories desk decorations surrounding creating setup thought like least important realize actually makes setup especially makes feel comfortable spend time first little notebook something always like desk setups use notebook write ideas flesh ideas find get better overview ideas see paper compared seeing computer screen also used solve problems i'm programming draw whenever i'm feeling inspired next shopping list looking notepad reason find writing to-dos actual piece paper crossing lot satisfying digitally also feels lot intuitive therefore shopping list type notepad desk write to-do's day pen use random ink pen green like choose decorative things colors feel natural like notebook pen desk times hydro flask water bottle use hydrate no actually one best purchases made 2020 thing australia start 2020 water bottle like able maintain temperature water inside amazing always using regular plastic water bottles water would get hot matter minutes plus plastic particles get water that's not good hydro flask great thing another thing desk also wireless charging station must-have today since phone charge way makes super simple put phone charge i'm working final pieces decorations paintings shelf honestly makes setup come together rarely put art walls even shelves wanted give try setup since got idea something thought would look really good leonardo da vinci always fascinated i've always liked draw sketches human body something always appealed think there's something amazing he's able use like lines sketches yet clearly see he's drawn reason sketches fascinate thought would nice idea hang one sketches wall i've admired drawing skull felt bit empty decided try find another one matched ended self-portrait sketch i'm super happy turned also idea putting shelf paintings led strip underneath light artwork add hanging plants add life wall turned better thought would along framed sketches favorite part setup made whole room feel much comfortable welcoming highly recommend decorating walls increase hominess feeling case wondering leds nothing really special they're cheap brand want orange looking light really cared able create light not believe lights made delta co uh yeah new desk setup right since know lot guys asking like desk chair i'm using not actually forget desk chair i'm using not really know random chair previous occupants like warehouse i'm actually left i'm not quite sure actually quite comfortable ideal desk chair actually want space going like herman miller ocean blue type desk chair see unfortunately not ship sweden means ca not really get quite yet i'll try figure way get somehow anyway that's one hope enjoyed hope i'll see next one [music] right today i'm going share reasoning behind program four hour sessions like four hours no break no nothing four hours straight programming may seem like lot people people might seem like that's nothing i've spent lot time trying optimize trying get like optimal kind balance productivity also rest recovery seems like four hours optimal time limit lot people right proponing something different like pomodoro technique super popular that's essentially study work like 45 minutes something like spend short amount time like resting take short break come back figured it'd interesting share essentially opposite i'm able get output work sprint not marathon think us actually work better terms sprints not marathons that's also think us familiar concept like night phenomenon like unique ability somehow write entire essay night due also think us part group studied little bit every day exam group okay kind joke that's not actually reason choose approach think generally better study little bit every day cram night exam essay due i'm trying get like unique ability seemingly like muster superhuman ability focus get work done night exam essay due that's like sit extended periods time one thing push hard short burst take longer rest recover way productive work terms sprints that's task switching huge drain energy output constantly switching tasks end not making much progress anything better way approach double one thing time spend significant amount time thing make progress get flow state term that's become really popular lately something experience easier get flow state lot time want get state order perform really well flow state essentially means roll whatever working hyper focused point feels effortless want achieve anytime work something also state want maintain long possible means costs avoid context switching soon need switch context work something new know lose flow state try get back new thing really difficult pomodoro technique like marathon sense working short amount time take short break work another short amount time take short break sustainable sense never really seems work well always seem end like one two places first one right i'm get rhythm work like sort like flow state that's alarm goes need take break kind interrupt flow working break go break come back always struggle like trying get back state takes little bit time second place end place like going break struggling actually stop break willpower still something that's like unnecessary risk opinion seems like that's usually happens pomodoro technique always end take break right i'm reach sort flow state kind seems like telling little kid not eat candy every 45 minutes need go candy store smell candy 5 10 minutes not really make sense approach instead work bursts energy sit one clearly defined task allocate enough time task really get done four hours neat number two hours three hours well whatever need get task done need work feature not inspired work not think sit desk open everything need order work usually thinking starting lose time think effort take start computer open text editor thinking much effort take time runs away sudden spent two hours not really anything procrastinating meant means actually wasted free time want avoid accidentally wasting time since time money say also want start using today's video sponsor privacy avoid accidentally losing money getting credit card information stolen right we're probably shopping online think going increase things become digital really important thing keep mind make sure banking information stays secure privacy lets buy things online using virtual cards instead real ones protecting identity bank information internet right new customers automatically get five dollars spend first purchase go privacy.com cal sign privacy no longer need run risk accidentally entering banking info sketchy site simply use one privacy's virtual cards super easy set military grade encryption not sell information privacy makes money merchants allows service completely free use plus they've added account summaries feature makes easier create track stick new year's resolution budgets go privacy.comcal get five dollars spend first purchase little bit sneaky procrastination actually spending free time procrastination essentially undeliberate spending free time sitting around like postponing thing need sitting around wasting time trying muster energy actually start working whatever need actually spending free time leads next point thinking would actually want time could anything great motivator sitting around trying build momentum start working meant likely sitting phone mindless activity time taking essentially using free time really useful trick tend use try think like would rather knew free time originally planned hour two free time would really want find usually come lot better answers like mindlessly scroll instagram usually procrastinate answers usually help actually motivate get back work find list long list things would want free time i'd planned kind motivates actually get free time work free time actually spend things really want reframing instead procrastinating work actually wasting free time makes getting started quite urgent since sooner start sooner done thus sooner get long list stuff really want seems like main thing want avoid procrastination way think work less things less interruptions way kind spend less time place procrastination occur something that's course like oversimplified right something try hardest achieve way try like eliminating things steps know distractions try put almost autopilot i'm something i'm know need work certain file computer try like mindlessly autopilot go computer start open file sit try not think things really good example actually something found recently night time i'm brush teeth usually usually takes long time one main distractions run mirror usually go bathroom look mirror i'm like trying check different like pimples whatever spent lot time actually trick used open like mirror doors opened not see face way went bathroom basically took floss started flossing like brush teeth like really simple hack that's one example try eliminate things know distractions that's really good way that's like 90 percent avoiding procrastination try avoid like distractions run part plan ahead marcus brownlee mkbhd actually interview mark zuckerberg not long ago asked like divides time different companies runs mark actually explained usually dedicate entire days different companies that's like instead something spend like hour morning working facebook two hours working instagram take break hour four hours whatsapp another hour facebook instead dedicates entire day whatsapp makes lot sense really useful technique clear boundaries said work whatsapp today anything not whatsapp not something work today easy figure focus not switch lots different contexts stay focused single problem single context make lot progress would also assume elon musk something similar companies he's running try apply similar concept idea want avoid task switching much possible relating back first point working sprints instead marathons sprint one day working one thing next day switch something else feel like make lot progress things i'm working way every sunday look to-do's figure coming week weekly plan fairly rough minimal try plan things absolutely must week inevitably change plan rough outline i'm going day allow actually reduce mental energy need put thinking need also means not need worry missing something important throughout week revise plan look changed need update day sit evening look got done today need push tomorrow look originally planned tomorrow see need change that's something that's actually really important lot times week change plans inevitably change things get way things not work way planned really good original structure week go kind revise things go along see worked not work hopefully next week better prepared plan week realistically better weeks able plan usually happen something today make tomorrow's to-do list obsolete something thought needed tomorrow actually needs done today sitting evening day really actually useful not plan planning feel rewarding productive sometimes dopamine trap mean sometimes plan lot like i've made mistake many times like sitting planning hour throughout day like okay morning i'm gonna spend two hours working i'm gonna one hour break eat watch something i'm gonna spend two hours usually happen day change wo not actually stick schedule perfectly means go half hour something sudden stuck state like trying catch schedule schedule set not actually super important that's usually ends happening that's think important try limit detailed plans usually happens days day gets way means sticking exact hourly schedule not always possible fact think less possible possible like structure days there's also balance often not really know long take us write essay planning much time spend not really going effective however creating rough structure day actually really good instance making sure start working certain time allocating big time slot working really good instance let's say start working 8 allowing time 8 12 uninterrupted working something put schedule scheduling think remain fairly unspecific allowing many long periods uninterrupted work possible not specifying get done anyway clear schedule clear mind hope enjoyed video want subscribe would yeah hope enjoyed hope i'll see next one oh x incredible get something like made five dollars right today i'm gonna see get app icon made ten dollars couple weeks back used fiverr get app design made turned like honestly surprised much actually liked lot guys asking actually make app order also need app icon that's we're gonna try find today really interesting see last time quite like expensive like big budget wanted see like get really tight budget i'm expecting surprised last time yeah anyway thank fiverr sponsoring video aka like financing app let's get started like look actual artists find make app icon us bima 28. ranked 4.9 200 reviews design simple memorable app logo icon 15 let's go taylor brands 32 reviews really like logo he's designed luxury geometric minimalist logo design right 20 dollars think that's good let's spice kicks say professionally work minimalist logo design 190 reviews that's really good 4.9 let's one artist nine design creative modern minimalist logo ten dollars really cheap oh unique minimalist logo design 12 hours logo bright 65 reviews 4.9 five dollars super cheap let's sent artists message letting know looking hi i'm looking get app icon logo made app called extra log app aimed elite level athletes advanced gym goers mock-up app design i've attached message want much creative freedom possible feel like going different color scheme go like simple clean minimalist logo designs alright results let's go see actually got really actually hope good really want able use least one like actual app icon let's go see got sent us let's start artist nine ten dollars got first one extra log like not know looks like lightning bolt sometimes go like they're trying imitate mimic i'm not really sure they've taken inspiration really actually like uh first logo second one arm flexed see like color scheme arm flexed feel like like obvious almost like generic app icon not personally really like one ideas head like asking logos like thinking wonder many people gonna send logo would like flexed arm got one that's good i'm pretty happy first one potential actual app let's move next one five dollar one logo bright five dollars expectations one really want one good would cool thing like need spend five dollars get really good app icon made first one think looks decent guess like person exercising sort they're taking generic kind approach like flexed arm person running that's kind generic description asked like logo artists wanted related like elite athletes advanced gym goers like trainers people work feel like actually appeal kind audience really like way done not like obvious person running think looks really good also goes color scheme actual app provided like example good thing even though asked like could come designs felt like different color scheme would work better first five dollars i'd super happy logos like that's incredible get something like made five dollars second one think actually contender like actual app icon like something i'd happy get done let's keep one mind that's like potential final one let's move taylor brands um one cost 20 dollars make get done mention like could get revisions done like yeah not really know say like not really like color scheme like orange blue i'm guessing they're going like they've probably found color scheme related exercise way that's commonly used fitness type areas looks really cheap not something would want use app icon also like e extra log thing like not actually provide app icon provide extra log text thing almost like thought company kind provided like mock-up thing almost like they've made sign that's printed glass kind looks okay guess app icon not feel like looks good not not least let's look spice kecks twenty dollars actually provided couple different variations well provided one black white like white outline like black outline basically see-through outline really like like tell inspired description like app elite level type athletes tell design logo kind feels like appeals sort audience think would look really good app icon well oh x think they've used x like x x log think that's they've used like inspiration outline actual thing they've made something looks like someone's who's like sprinting something that's sprinting like downside sort similar gymshark logo similarities not think similar point similarities definitely contender top spot like i'm i'd super happy save time spend 20 20 fiverr get apple icon made like think would worth like every time bima 28 15 one artists actually talk lot ones first provided like mock-ups able give feedback like one mock-ups liked wanted anything changed able like kind work like keep developing fact i'm trying make like much scientific experiment i'm not really much not give feedback anything also something keep mind person would definitely put effort like changing would asked done considering think one best designs we've seen well final result actually really clean looking app icon 50 would super happy especially want emphasize fact much effort put actually asking input along way considering i'd super happy one right final design saw like five dollar one i'm super surprised five dollar one easily opinion one best ones i'd love get input one would actually one thought best i'm gonna add like little like voting thing not know works right i'm gonna add something like vote design like one guys like app icon actually end using app whenever get actually publishing hope soon not know much time take yeah make sure vote also subscribe follow along i'll coming updates like app building process going uh yeah hope enjoyed video hope realize worth actually spend like five dollars ten dollars fiverr get app icon like made uh makes much sense usually end creating something kind like not actually good design people actually know they're come way better designs ever could probably unless like really good graphic designer anyway seems like definitely get app icon made less ten dollars that's one hope enjoyed video hope i'll see next one video i'm gonna go three skills think every programmer order able create company want straight away three skills app development networking basics databases one skills average yearly income us ranges eighty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars not could provide average income also equip tools need become next bill gates mark zuckerberg build something like facebook fans paypal instagram whatsapp bitcoin need know three knowing three mean alone build things giving opportunity create wealth basically nothing skills allow create companies things make money they're not need get job they're skills think every programmer leverage infinite opportunities provide skills behind world's profitable businesses important one able create apps mobile web businesses listed need bear essential exist need know develop either web apps mobile apps maximum leverage opportunity know suggest learning flutter react native maximum leverage want learn fewest number things possible give largest return flutter react native allow build android ios time means need build app run anywhere think useful skill could programmer able build multi-platform apps not think cross-platform frameworks better native ones think apps come not really need native development there's reasons would actually motivate building app twice go multi-platform web development recommend react learn work javascript html css using web framework react web framework especially useful since react also available mobile react native means learning react essentially learn build websites mobile apps minimum work maximum leverage learn one framework build web mobile simultaneously able build thing people interact step one truly make useful need understand basics networking specifically want learn different types http requests clients versus servers work apis work also create one going back facebook example first skill lets us build shell facebook lets us build something looks like facebook step lets us understand facebook works hood different types http requests gets sent press like button instance front end talks back end via api app building part skin networking part organs brain lets organism function combined next skill list essentially backend development umbrella category networking would also include learning work json combined next skill list essentially backend development know final piece puzzle figure databases work databases super important know work things list i'm not saying know heart without using google i'm saying try things try build something actually works implements technologies done able probably better programming not knowing exactly type get code run understanding want done need understand skills generally work use know google specifics build something like facebook today would still need google stuff like build rest api using python start postgres database host code server somewhere build site app key thing know use i've done even though still need google stuff lots lots things still things head somewhere wo not take long reignite aim general understanding not mastery think mastery overrated skills believe give anyone learns basic tool set needed create financial freedom thing left learning skills figure build make no mistake difficult part however good way find ideas look emerging trends today's video sponsor morning brew actually really useful morning brew free daily newsletter comes monday saturday really like high quality information that's easily digestible morning brew never read news felt like every news outlet pretty much selling bad news that's not morning brew morning brew witty relevant informative really like also think latest one instance learned apps trending right highly privacy oriented super useful information anyone looking develop apps highly recommend trying free not sign morningbrew today using link video description takes 15 seconds subscribe example skills used look bitcoin whatsapp even though seem wildly different things they're actually not they're true testament skills used create vastly different output build whatsapp first need create app allows people type messages want send secondly need create api host server allow people send receive messages thirdly need create database store message history user possibly profile pictures login info bitcoin uses three principles order create something like bitcoin need good understanding networking works first need place people go buy sell mine coins need website secondly need host website somewhere need server need create api kind send money remotely thirdly need sort database actually keep track transactions made tell description fundamental skills need build two pretty much exactly difference gets used clever use networking conjunction brilliant use cryptography creation decentralized currency known bitcoin possible one brilliant parts bitcoin decentralization still need host database somewhere means need know things networking servers also need website host database people find bitcoin true testament accomplished single individual right knowledge ingenuity even no one knows many people behind bitcoin three skills foundation allowed happen understanding things not hard coming idea like bitcoin hand hard seems three skills much like samuel l jackson they're everything alright not forget subscribe hope enjoyed hope i'll see next one\n",
