            "what's everybody how's going what's everybody how's going we've done two quizzes past software engineering quizzes non-coding girlfriend aka megan i'll go girl oh i'll go girl become name pretty well first one first one like year ago pretty badly second one yeah year like october 2019 third one except time picked questions we're asking megan ready redeem third grade redeem good last one moving green i'm not thinking i'm gonna great one either feel like guys gonna ask questions i'm not gonna know really fun questions i'm gonna make answers like always think would want not know best best okay jump one thing actually filmed another video megan's channel guys know wear black outfit every day well went shopping picked outfit wear dinner date fun get tired seeing outfit drives insane mean ended liking outfit though yeah let's not spoil anything go check i'll put link description comments want see otherwise let's jump quiz rolled eyes talking cut know editing 13 question quiz there's one bonus 14th question end let's jump first one liked question want software engineer google want software engineer google no not software engineer would love mean visiting google i'd love work really cool not know there's place give question need like uh need um like google fashion line google styling yeah guess could could could style google slag yeah that'd great okay we'll give question not really like real question let's jump question number two one actually favorite question actually laughed loud saw one involves computer programming meg code editor kind like text editor know no way think like know microsoft word google docs called vim okay special type code editor i'm going show file look i'll show file we're going open file file see says text file there's typo file right see typo another one fix typos save file exit that's question ca not go edit like ca not click come figure got use keyboard like arrow keys maybe oh arrow keys control z oh wait exited original question person asked open exit well messed know photoshop stuff control okay one happened yeah messed one exit outsmarted i'll go expert okay well ca not exit no not work literally ca not oh boy wait hell prep type qa press enter exit vin jesus okay we're going skip question together want try well i'll give point question original question i'll put screen literally open think know use arrows let's skip next question stressed stressed okay no one saw way okay forget saw happened okay question number three following computer science subjects except one computer science concepts password salt debug lube honey pot syntactic sugar i'll repeat one time password salt debug lube honey pot syntactic sugar last one not computer science concept yeah nope second try lube one yes okay no know instinct like okay definitely blue one i'm like oh like not know went back i'm like oh that's obvious want get right well that's guess first one got wrong okay next one pretty fun one question number four i'm show logo programming language tell us name program logo c plus not language not one that's like c lot languages c there's c there's c plus plus oh not c plus one literally written like c sign that's name language c c oh gosh i'm mad i'm literally music person like said music note sharp that's sign sharp yes not even know i'm idiot literally choir like entire not even know i'm okay i'm idiot okay well two two question number five stack overflow i'm going give three answers programming language operating system online platform allows 70 software engineers computer programmers keep jobs first like what's question stack overflow ready begin programming language operating system online platform allows 70 software engineers computer programmers keep jobs second one operating system yeah think that's like one would think no one yes third one i'm like foreign q style website like programmers always not know anyone would think would know answers though like algo girl claims know know scare design large-scale distribution not claim not claim ask want know okay question number six one important one contentious one not answer incorrectly spaces tabs spaces tabs okay programming often like know spacing programming like see stuff like see there's like spacing right like indented indented spaces tabs rather indented spaces tabs either tabs correct would actually say tab feel like uses tab always feel like he's pounding tab oh goodness pounding tab types we've working work home since i've staying we've working hardest thing focus like terrible like type know terrible vigorously apparently pound tab key okay we'll give there's really no clue well clear answer tabs not spaces right smash like button agree okay number seven work every day html css javascript react type software engineer front end back end front end yay said like happily knew one know like agua expert co-workers back end stuff told bunch times simon friend know not antoine antondo's back yeah antoine important simon literally not say yeah that's implied no way nothing said got one right okay number eight binary tree okay see structure kind looks like tree add stuff got nodes values cases values numbers right invert binary tree since know know not going able actually code whatever rather tell mean invert binary tree since always like remind us scariest thing world not know like switching around like kind like mirroring yeah like would two three yeah would three two yes give would six five yes would first inverted seven gets point know symmetry no symmetry okay question number nine sort popular type uh interview question used asked sophomore engineers asked product managers days many ping pong balls fit bus not know would answer interview bus load bus okay we'll give one creativity answer would come would say well okay well big bus big ping pong ball fit like smooshing stack not going think much problem solve mega okay we'll give one creativity though not even created okay question number 10 following languages closest hardware computer kind like lowest level programming language java assembly c plus plus python assembly yes correct no idea suddenly approved okay see thinking okay actually might like make wrong assembly like back end front end none front end well guess python kind used front end assembly yeah assembly kind okay not know said assembled got not ask not ask get question right keep going okay not get question right quiz not know worked go professor ask no i've not taken quiz long question number 11 pronounce word abbreviation right skull skull squeal skull squeal no neither i'm stabbing secule no swole squeal secules three wrong four wrong turtles squirtle five wrong guesses no either sql sequel got one wrong um well not c sequel would guessed sequel sequel like intonation like sequel right letter c read letters sql well would read letters sql said not announce not okay true false javascript used friend development false good owe something question said back end like no java not never mind not know guess keep getting questions right like not actually okay final question bonus one methods functions thing method function thing programming no idea yes give answer yes yes yes not told no idea would thought really good programming okay done really well let's tally everything go bonus nine questions got correct that's pretty good let's see let's think first quiz got 8 13. let's see get bonus question correct bonus one people program programming language program programming languages allow program programs programming languages i'm going need repeat actually dumb question well actually good like philosophical question kind like programming language many programming languages written programming languages like remember not get remember correctly javascript not javascript written c plus plus c something asking c written that's not get like not know like born like chicken egg programming language programming yeah not know not know okay well not get bonus yeah know confusing okay let find one one last bonus question know what's answer well we're gonna skip no we're gonna we're gonna save long answer okay we'll one last bonus question i'm gonna go list try find cool one give one second really lie give second [music] like hard okay okay let's go yeah another annoying one gonna ask what's difference api library like annoying question would not even know say that's rude calling one subscribers annoying no good question whoever asked name name oh someone's getting shout yeah name ryan stricker good question also called annoying know question not like okay true false hey guys how's going cairo coach not know question okay think that's gonna gonna get like kind 9 13 maybe 10 13. think megan algo girl quiz let us know comments think bit better previous two quizzes also kind really good kind easier quiz would not say not forget check video filmed next channel want see yes come join channel fun light airy colorful torture wearing colored outfit otherwise um anything remind users smash like button subscribe channel not already go check aguaexpert.com use documents yeah okay okay anyway use discount platform discount code meg m-e-g m-g follow linkedin um twitter enjoy short formatting content instagram like pictures otherwise see next video oh instagram lovemagwilliams sure what's everybody how's going today story time day that's right video i'm going sharing story first ever software engineering job interview channel i've talked interviews google facebook i've even shared failed coding interview stories lyft two sigma i've never talked first software engineering job interview unique one want video think lessons extract namely four lessons hopefully find insightful without ado sit back grab beverage choice smash like button youtube algorithm let's dive story story brings us way back late december 2016 four years ago date i'm filming releasing video absolutely mind-boggling think four years since first software engineering job interview graduated couple weeks earlier coding bootcamp brand new software engineering job search process one first companies applied one small company time think three four people working name company product they're still alive thriving right far know uh name replit repple.it fact might familiar company might even use product not familiar product basically offer online code editor use build sort application want execute code right even collaborative editor offer ability actually like host deploy applications they've really grown lot really awesome website product rather used ton coding bootcamp would always go replit know code uh anything algorithms uh know projects sorts things really liked product near end december couple weeks coding boot camp noticed website hiring think know jobs page said uh know we're hiring software engineers send us email interested tell us something built recently sent email told working recently i'll probably put screenshot email somewhere screen pleasant surprise answered within couple days basically told wanted interview brings first lesson interview experience even though i've first person say past applying jobs especially software engineering industry applying online probably worst strategy easy application go nowhere exception applying small company time especially company literally puts email contact page jobs page actually pretty high chance getting email application seen real human know fact know days run company i'll go expert way preparing coding interviews systems design interviews check company i'll go expert go algoxprep.com clem discounted platform algo expert we're also comparably small company least team point view know fact see basically contact messages come way course not invitation contact us looking job we're not hiring right want emphasize fact smaller company likely actually get front human get interview company product really enjoy using happen see team page page jobs page email sort contact form invite reach definitely might land interview anyway going back story responded email decided offer interview interview process began process not involve classic algorithm style coding interviews like ones prepare algo expert makes sense like said small startup really needed someone know jump start building stuff not really make sense necessarily assess algorithm-style interview instead build little project first build one know comfort home went well told would fly san francisco bay area believe not project home took know day liked enough fly kid not flew uh week days christmas like december 18th think 2016. remember felt like absolutely awe like graduated coding boot camp took pretty big gamble jump software engineering industry i've told high demand industry i'll easy time getting job getting flown expenses paid know san francisco bay area wanted go someone new york uh know small company like like whoa like incredible stayed think couple days hung team built another project person know build something little bit robust think worked collaborative editor back not offer collaborative feature editor know sort google docs style editor that's kind worked kind tried build otherwise know hung team went dinner lunch whatever really good time really nice way entire process not pay go also paid work forget paid work paid work get like take home assignment either way paid really generously like like awesome overall gave great experience came thinking like company legit like representative entire software engineering industry made right choice going coding bootcamp left really happy know pleased company brings lesson number two lesson number two think going relevant building running company rather know software engineer interviewing company want really commend replica team founders think giving good experience candidates treating well even not much experience zero work experience goes long way shows like good company know not i'm like big deal video gonna know help ton look i'm making video tells know lot people great company puts positive light that's largely gave great experience interviewed know get good karma treating candidates well also not get roasted joshua fluke youtube okay interview point ended remember flew back san francisco bay area new york finished process work done person not particularly amazing sense not built actual collaborative editor done little bit remember felt little bit overwhelmed suddenly thrown production grade code base like said not work experience first time developing real world project pretty tough feel like i'd done well turned know not get job ended rejecting remember pretty disappointed mean gotten really invested process company started kind daydreaming oh get job get work product i've really enjoyed using get move san francisco bay area friends whole like fantasy oh know silicon valley entrepreneurship know not work remember really disappointed pretty brutal job search process followed interview know i've said many times past go hundreds applications went absolutely nowhere got interviews january february unfortunately not get offers took get big break google turned great eventually times couple months really hard really disappointing remember kept thinking like gotten job replit like things would good brings final two lessons want share experience first one applying small company one downside applying small company not much work experience not much experience general not really matter work experience experience developer may hard time passing interviews generally speaking qualified job really think small company especially one three four employees like gonna really looking someone immediately get speed get ramped code base contribute make meaningful changes brand new software engineering like coming coding bootcamp that's going tough also not really going able get kind mentorship might able get larger company that's not say experience small startup like would not valuable would point view might tougher justify hiring gonna harder time opinion landing job small company feel running algo expert art company hire let's say software engineer right really would need someone could immediately make meaningful changes not really capacity luxury afford train someone mentor ramp three months six months no would not able not luxury whereas company like google microsoft amazon huge right even mid-sized company might opportunity that's uh one lesson learn smaller company really able prove independent software engineer ramp super quickly fourth final lesson want bring one little bit kind philosophical emotional whatever want call going go failures life also job search process software engineer know failures pretty tough deal like remember like said super disappointed particular um failure job interview hindsight i'm actually glad turned way that's not like bass replit say know ended somewhere better no not say hindsight not rejected replit eventually led interviewing google getting google eventually led building algo expert would not built not gone coding interviews get google also eventually led building youtube channel largely focused around google coding interviews big tech companies would not today obviously i'm really happy career entrepreneurial journey led right i'm really good place would not way granted hindsight also no idea life would brought accepted replit gone work replit ca not say i'm sad point i'm trying make not meant sort know everything meant anything like no treat failure door closes potential opportunity something else every door closes there's another one opens that's would treat going sort rejection software engineering job search process life general try treat opportunity closed new opportunity opened that's would view certainly case hindsight think it'll help know deal rejection going anyway that's story wanted share hopefully found insightful interesting four lessons hopefully meant something let know thought comments relate not forget subscribe channel not already smash like button forgot earlier follow linkedin twitter enjoy short form written content instagram like pictures otherwise see next video not get drunk cold water let explain what's everybody how's going video want share seven seven seven holy never seven seven things people not tell entrepreneurship i've living entrepreneurial lifestyle almost four years i've running business algo expert way software engineer preparing coding interviews systems design interviews check company i'll go expert go algo expert.young user promo code clem clem discount platform last four years we've gone lot we've achieved level success know 50 000 paying customers feel like i've got little bit insight share want video not really going lessons much they're going warnings words wisdom either way let's jump first one something i've said past channel think bears repeating living entrepreneurial lifestyle incessant amount work there's constantly work no matter think trust going think reach certain milestone launch certain feature going able sit back relax little bit wo not much work not true there's always stuff always things improve product service ways improve internal processes there's always always always work topic work brings second thing something i've recently talked linkedin twitter way not following consider following basically grand majority work going company business going unglamorous work not going super exciting stuff going lot unsexy work things like filing taxes creating accounts products use business customer service that's big one fixing little bugs software engineer product tech product things going take majority time going many not exciting come entrepreneurship especially someone who's going maybe ceo company like come thinking oh i'm going know jeff bezos i'm gonna super cool things every day know not gonna like get ready lot dirty work speak nothing beneath nothing beneath brings point number three might thinking well there's much unglamorous work not delegate work right delegate people hire people work think common misconception not get wrong delegation important especially growing company think delegation rather easy delegate often overestimated words people think far easier delegate actually benefits delegation oftentimes also overestimated think delegating task going come sort upfront cost going find person delegate task takes lot time ca not make wrong hiring decision ca not find wrong person otherwise going cost arm leg road train person make sure they're able task without needing much help make sure task competently often times there's much overhead much upfront operational cost even line operational cost delegation not actually serve purpose think also something lot companies mess lot companies start delegate way fast way quickly they'll delegate things really not need delegate even though yes annoying they'll delegate know ten different things they've got 10 new people working company not enough work work end coming back know person created company asking help guidance not good point delegation oftentimes not answer experience fourth thing lot highs lows throughout entrepreneurial journey feel highs lows strongly best way explain working company normal employee like example back worked google facebook life level excitement company tends kind stable words know stable paycheck stable job maybe get promoted know year every two years bit excitement overall not like every week every month even every day get like different levels know really high excitement really low excitement whereas running business every day every week every month every quarter seeing firsthand things like revenue sales metrics traffic website types things affects directly livelihood not like company getting paycheck every week great day business know maybe record day revenue gonna super excited like three bad days keep going even worse know bad weeks bad months take like big toll kind like wrong maybe i'm something wrong not maybe probably i'm responsible basically entirely right highs lows far pronounced ready fifth thing actually related previous one specifically highs proverb saying father used tell younger love proverb goes like not get drunk cold water let explain running business inevitably least hopefully reach certain milestones success like example record month sales maybe record day sales something blows every month day water going super excited going feel top world going drunk happiness excitement ego feeling invincibility truth oftentimes especially excitements peaks short-term like they're caused something acute like day record day sales getting drunk cold water words they're not getting drunk know hardcore vodka whatever top tier alcohol i'm not big drinker um getting drunk nothing getting drunk no reason not good might setting either disappointment no longer work hard think made really not road gonna start see daily sales go gonna wonder know happened one day amazing point not get drunk cold water even great successes not mean not appreciate not happy still gotta put work still gotta operate fire sense urgency forth sixth thing teammates specifically co-founders founding team people working day day thing want share relationship relationships people going much tried tested think running business co-founder co-founders founding team going working time long span time know there's saying not memphis saying lot people entrepreneurial world say co-founders kind like spouses different capacity obviously think true operating stressful environment 24 7 almost see different know version person kind circumstances relationship going put test i'm really happy know algo expert we've got really good relationships people founding team know co-founder rest executive team two people know talking 24 7. like times we've borderline like fights know come like big disagreements intense disagreements like know not know sorts things they've gone rough times business high times business right highs lows like got ready that's think important looking co-founder co-founders really think like going able person long period time every single day like gonna work level trust respect survive circumstances seventh last thing want tell hopefully we'll end video lighter note realized first six things kind negative seventh thing no matter anybody might tell lot people actually try discourage get entrepreneurship they'll tell things like really stressful kind true they'll tell things like startups fail going really unstable uncertain things true six things said previously true like said they're kind negative despite despite worth someone who's watching video who's kind unfazed first six things said kind like borderline motivated like yeah still appeals idea running business entrepreneurship believe say worth worth still like amazing thing would not know want anything else super rewarding yeah go note hope found video insightful not forget smash like button subscribe channel not already follow linkedin twitter enjoy short form written content instagram like pictures see next video what's everybody how's going channel posted lot videos google coding interviews i've done google coding interviews i've talked prepare google coding interviews land google coding interviews one thing not really talked exactly candidate going google coding interview graded grading rubric interviewers google big tech companies use grade score candidates video going demystify lot misconceptions myths online let's dive going look template algo expert way preparing coding interviews especially get company like google big tech company check company i'll go expert go algo expert dot io uses promo code clem clem discount platform algo expert mock interview feature mock interviews people algo expert done mock interview give feedback interview partner go feedback form one i'm looking right free template i'll put link description comments look leisure want scroll uh feedback form get part interviewee feedback four main categories performance form right similar form interviewers google even big tech companies access course there's little bit clementization form know wrote form wrote like descriptions hover numbers various scores various categories overall similar first thing pop see form realize simple almost like disappointingly simple expecting see something would make think like whoa i've seen secret insider formula crack google coding interview well going disappointed that's not case not rocket science anything grading rubric front us looks kind obvious right kind know super simple four categories kind makes sense right algorithm skills coding skills communication skills problem solving skills that's that's assessed four point scale category clear makes lot sense end day there's many things algorithm style coding interview like ones take google assess right many things interview give signal taking algorithmic style coding interview four main things that's assessed let's dive understand like represent represents we'll start first algorithms algorithms kind like bread butter um not necessarily important others know de facto thing think think algorithm style coding interview talk algorithms really mean well-versed algorithms able come optimal solution problem given optimal algorithm understand space-time complexity analysis understand know certain algorithms might perform better others understand trade-offs algorithms well-versed data structures good grasp data structures might good certain know problems data structures might not good certain problems mean algorithms look best score algorithms says candidate came one multiple optimal algorithms solve question little no help interviewer candidate demonstrated clear mastery algorithms data structures exactly kind iterated right look two candidate came algorithm solve question unable solve optimally despite help interviewer candidate gaps knowledge algorithms data structures kind get idea category represents pretty straightforward would encourage go check form read scores descriptions leisure next we've got coding coding kind obvious right coding interview course going assessed coding ability one thing keep mind coding ability coding interview much coding ability signal give interviewee right not like writing huge project application tons different files whatever know writing know short things considered solution algorithmic problem things interviewer going looking going things like variable naming naming variables descriptively keeping code dry abstracting repeated logic structuring code way makes sense know separating maybe isolated pieces logic using idiomatic syntax language although say know depending level might less important like new grad interviewing l3 position might not really care using idiomatic javascript example still things keep mind best score coding ability candidate effortlessly transcribed algorithm working readable code candidate abstracted repeated logic helper methods named variables descriptively used idiomatic language syntax exactly said third thing going communication one pretty self-explanatory communicating well interviewer able follow go interview communicating thinking know considering multiple approaches problem telling considering telling considering sometimes people they're going think three different approaches they're not going tell interviewer that's not good finally fourth uh category problem solving problem solving little bit nuanced think lot candidates kind conflate algorithms kind tied algorithms little bit different problem solving approach problem approach way sound conveys good problem solver little bit place example ask clarifying questions consider multiple approaches consider multiple approaches consider using know various data structures explain trade-offs think one might better voice interviewer problem solving lends solved sub problems know maybe one logical kind isolated part second isolated part solve separately kind jump without really thinking test code end proactively explain interviewer would test code good ways indicate good problem solver that's they're looking category two things note first one main categories really graded others example know might things like leadership google there's one category called thrives ambiguity little bit nuanced they're harder assess coding interview interviewer able get signal they'll fill overall candidate would not really worried coding interview not systems designer behavioral right we're talking coding interviews coding interviews would really worry main four categories obvious ones supremely important make break interview course things like respectful know template we've got first question second one person respectful professional that's obviously super important second thing notice four scores categories say people expect kind fancy grading scheme like oh like 17 points like no not fancy makes sense not rocket science reason four points graded not know 10 points would really differentiate seven eight know not much right would much harder kind explain know difference seven eight makes lot sense would highly encourage go check template read descriptions kind get idea two versus three versus one means jump scores probably want aim candidate let's talk final score end interview interviewer filled form final score sort decision hiring decision interviewer giving hiring committee six one one that's pretty like famous probably heard online probably even heard jokes know strong no higher strong higher yes got six uh hiring decisions strong no higher no higher leaning no higher leaning higher higher strong higher kind speak strong higher means interviewer really thinks hired would almost fight hired defend position strong no hire going opposite everything use judgment look descriptions algo expert understand represent last thing want talk video i'm sure lot wondering many combination scores know many strong hires many leaning hires need actually get hired google remember going google coding interviews big tech company interviews go typically four five on-site interviews going get one scores many know combination scores performance chart need get individual final score unfortunately expecting kind super scientific formula well going disappointed much art science first looking performance hard tell know combination scores need get example strong hire would say rule thumb make sense read actual individual descriptions rule thumb candidate hoping get threes fours dip twos twos little bit negative ones not good not want ones threes fours good ideally get fours threes know least like two fours much art science candidates might extremely good three categories might get fours three categories two fourth category example common see someone really good algorithms coding problem solving not amazing communication really good algorithms problem solving communication we're really bad coding ca not transcribe algorithm working code even people really good algorithms coding communication bad problem solving not really explain got solution typically case they'll also kind poor communication point there's many different possible combinations scores depending actual interview interviewer hard say know combination gonna best obviously four fours ideal hard say maps final score overall threes fours likely going leaning higher higher strong higher final scores obviously higher score better like got strong hires that's gonna best unless get strong hires conversely strong no hires unless get two scores hard say whether not combination scores going map end higher decision no higher decision actual hiring committee there's much art goes hiring committee process review four five on-site interview scores example know someone might get let's say three hires one strong hire would think oh god amazing one strong no higher might actually cost entire know position strong no higher might convincing example hires strong hires got told hiring committee great communication great problem solving not amazing coding like great everything not amazing coding strong no hires said really terrible coding clearly there's clear sign bad coding could push hiring committee edge even though bunch hires conversely imagine know four hires one strong no higher strong no higher said terrible communication hires said great communication gave four would make hiring committee look person gave bad communication score try understand better maybe know would kind red flag interviewer maybe interviewer not experienced not know i'm throwing ideas point could still end getting hired despite strong no higher really depends impossible know also impossible candidate know score got never know even get google later never know actual interview scores overall not something would really worry not something would try prepare thing prepare algorithms coding communication problem solving even overall nothing i've said video going really help crack interviews better thing hopefully done giving bit peace mind interviews not rocket science they're pretty straightforward assessed pretty simple straightforward things things considered four things go prepare interviews practice use algo expert good clam clem discounted platform get google big tech company hope video helpful hopefully insightful not forget smash like button subscribe channel not already follow linkedin twitter enjoy short formatting content instagram like pictures otherwise see next video let's see many times i'm gonna say phrase google coding interview two minute intro what's everybody how's going dire need google coding interview far long since i've made google coding interview video that's we're google coding interview google coding interview unlike lot previous google coding interviews channel not google coding interview international grand master competitive programming i'm not google coding interview someone who's medal international olympiad informatics no google coding interview normal software engineer lot commented previous google coding interview videos wanted see perhaps realistic performance google coding interview i'm joined kirti software engineer based india far know not elite level international grand master competitive programmer not medals international olympiad informatics going realistic google coding interview google coding interview google doc that's coding interviews done google especially right even sites virtual they're done google doc question asked kirti hard question algo experts way preparing coding interviews want get job google big tech company go check company i'll go expert go algox use promo code clem clem discount platform we've helped tons software engineers land jobs google big tech companies startups question actually question asked google real interview year two years ago last thing jump interview actually second google coding interview kirti's channel got channel talks software engineering coding interviews go sell love check finish watching google coding interview put link google coding interview description comments enjoy google coding interview many times say google coding interview oh try solve problem watch video comment would solve oh last 10 minutes video feedback session cover kirti's performance not want miss hi kirati how's going um excited interview i'm excited nervous okay well try not nervous try let nerves uh fuel acing interview i'm gonna put timer clock we're gonna 45 minutes i'll let know know we're running time speeding things okay right starting clock kierke want imagine want imagine move maybe moving new location want find apartment want live imagine one street street imagine single line imagine know single line i'm drawing i'm typing bunch ones show single file line block line there's apartment imagine i'm probably going give list list blocks street blocks block index there's apartment might want consider living following far yeah okay want make sure apartment live really good way going determine good apartment close buildings really value example really value might really value close gym close office close supermarket make sense yeah i'm going give information block whether not there's building like office like not school gym gonna want find apartment minimizes farthest distance would walk get buildings value realize i've given lot information i'm going show couple sample inputs get idea imagine first amp sample input going called blocks going list let put like um bunch objects know like know hash tables speak um objects buildings map booleans index zero see there's gem maps false meaning block zero no gym school no store block one gym no school no store make sense yeah okay second input i'm gonna give going list required buildings go little bit lower i'll put rex requires requirements going list strings list strings going buildings value happen value gym school store could maybe give like gym school could give gin right could buildings not necessarily objects value gym school store means find block apartment way every block apartment apartments kind implied every block find block minimize farthest distance would go reach requirements sample input answer would index three would one want highlight let's say light green one one farthest walk get required buildings gym school store distance one school right gym one store one okay okay three things gym school store number things number buildings thing blocks block information every single building example add something like not know office could expect every block would data point office whether true false okay valid input not check whether four present not right yeah not check whether four present always present okay oh okay top head talk fruitful solution consider block solution keep calculating distance right okay suppose consider apartment like case see multiple things apartment gym well school right yeah yeah distance zero plus zero like uh keep calculating minimum distance traverse array uh wherever find minimum one return yeah okay walk conceptually like exactly find minimum distance okay uh suppose suppose requirement gym school okay come three number variables requirements number variables right going keep two variables distance minimum distance gen well minimum distance per school result store minimum sum right minimum result possible three variables one distance gym gym distance uh school distance resultant minimum value okay since false school distance become uh 1 initially maximum value say take infinity max infinity zero right come okay uh gym um gym true gym distance becomes zero since traveled one distance become sort resultant previous one plus 1 right distance plus 1 keep checking whether resultant updated not right earlier result max not possible read uh reach gem every point seeing blocks not blocks right right traverse entire thing check uh also possible minimum right hand right like instead left hand right hand well probably traverse array twice one left side one right side check answer keep walking uh path clear looking minimum minimal farthest distance would walk right example like index three answer farthest distance would walk still one even though school zero would walk one get gym one get store make sense please repeat point yeah since multiple requirements might multiple requirements want minimize farthest distance greatest distance would walk care gym school store school zero distance index right okay jim walk one go store walk one find point i'm trying make want make sure clear farthest distance go minimizing not distance okay not okay understood wrong understood sum distances not like like farthest anyone go right yes exactly not even though sum like uh guess two not care farthest would go okay like minimize max gym distance school distance essentially uh yes yeah okay that's one way put yeah minimize maximum value among requirements sound fine yep think sounds good uh basically hash map sort thing ordered map corresponding requirement keep maximum distance right uh minimize okay okay corresponding okay keep okay entire array give second entire array block need uh minimize maximum distance suppose calculate maximum distance become order n square brute force become order n square block check maximum distance blocks right similarly block check blocks minimize make order use dynamic programming store values array see dp array distances sort vectors vectors distances max distances requirements okay right like suppose n blocks right dp oh okay uh auto thing i'm not really caring okay okay yeah caps lock uh i'll keep dp array size n suppose okay vector vector vector integers say dp entire size n vector size size requirements okay say case initialize whole thing maximum value look fine okay right traverse start writing pseudo code we'll we'll keep discussing want uh make sure follow could re-walk like logic gonna write pseudocode okay uh array vectors i'm storing right traverse array point i'm going keep calculating like see answers previous update like maximum uh distance school maximum distance previous one plus one not present right okay basically calculating maximum distance requirement uh block array yeah sound fine yep said one iteration uh take two iterations think one uh i'll go left right right one right left see okay sound fine take minimum yeah think think i'm following want write pseudo code going write okay i'll write simple terms equal 0 less n plus plus okay traversing entire array right element track requirements right n equal j equal zero j less size requirements right yeah j plus plus i'll first one first one update i'll traverse equal one also assume least one element uh handle cases there's one uh one block two blocks let's find there's always let's assume know simplicity there's always least one requirement one block yeah okay case point j equal zero first block okay first block go blocks given blocks 0 first block seeing element saying say input given terms requirements 0 1 2 uh save thing like uh like preprocess thing save uh know array sort thing basically i'm trying say block 0 requirement 0 requirement requirement two see um uh requirements vector string vector simpler assume pre-processed map requirements numbers that's easier would rather write pre-processing code well okay go like let's assume written understand saying basically requirements look like like right map zero one two yeah i'm assuming would would blocks like unordered map keys unordered map yes integer boolean boolean integer okay that's fine yeah let's let's go okay uh uh first block requirement jth requirement update distance dp otherwise max side otherwise one update dp 0 g 2 0 distance zero one okay okay uh fine till first block yeah done first block yes rest block i'm starting equal 1 less n sorry rest blocks dp ith block j going equal find maximum farthest go right uh fathers go first check one true blocks ij means present assign dp j 0 means thing present not present check present somewhere earlier right distance previous one plus one right uh possible not found previous one value int max add plus 1 go 1 right add check dp minus 1 j not equal max right dp ij equal minimum whatever value max not consider 0 ok minimum dp minus 1 j plus 1 seem fine yeah yeah uh going left right right updating maximum distance go right instead one thing keep one plus ah one instead last element i'm going store uh minimum values like maximum distance go right minimize farthest distance go blocks right block find dp basically storing one element essentially maximum distances block right calculating right ending yeah dp instead yeah add dp equal maximum initially okay add dp im 0 right assume least find maximum distance right value maximum initially anyway always max right answer always end max initialize dp im 0 make dp dp j whatever value calculated value greater add i'm storing maximum value make sense yes yep updating iteration maximum men distance requirement found exactly right done i'm going left right uh maximum furthest distance also right left right yeah whole thing like code run direction well right right end equal n minus 1 greater equal 0. copy whole thing make small changes yeah right odp im not update 0 value already not want discard value right right block i'll check remain instead minus 1 i'll make plus 1 instead n minus 1 i'll go n minus 2 greater equal 0 max yeah think work i'm sorry dry run check questions point yeah gonna say could walk like let's let's take sample input gem school store assume guess gym zero school one store two walk algorithm know like basically iteration iteration see works conceptually right i'll store dp values right okay uh dp like 0th value values initially uh instead writing max going write big number 100 right easier understand okay yeah want even put like um like asterisks like single character like okay dp zero first we'll go one school true something like asterisk zero asterisk last value asterisk okay last value take maximum three okay okay uh also okay tricky part also not uh taken care resultant maximum tp im essentially calculate okay let's first see rest working not dp i1 yeah yeah come put dp im 0 ok block check true ok otherwise add distance okay since true distance going 0 right false either int max plus 1 going 1 distance store going plus 1. since max i'm going keep max dp im going max since asterisk also asterisk maximum distance infinity right um stop one second make sure we're page applying effectively applying line right copied line written yes right second element took minimum element int max dp minus one j zero yes plus one yes z yeah yeah okay mid min n max zero plus one yes okay makes sense yeah coming second element uh values going since true going 0 also true 0 since false minimum either max max plus 1 since int max value maximum not get updated farthest distance till still infinity right come gem false either 0 max 0 plus 1 case 1 true school true store false infinity infinity okay 4 false max distance two zero store wait zero zero one two three four okay uh true going finally become 0 dp im equal max dpf im dp ij maximum value oh sorry yeah maximum value 2 right farthest distance 2 case yeah right line make sure we're page line using dp next four value maximum dp um max initialized max correct yeah yeah um oh yeah initialized every single value max uh no also initialize dp im zero right value right initialize zero yeah okay max zero sorry max zero dp j um would like basically every iteration would max zero two max two zero two zero end two right okay okay second iteration answer remain i'm going start n minus 2 one okay start gen value initially okay since false i'm going i'm going take uh i'm right either minimum dp plus 1 j either minimum 1 minimum 2 plus 1 3 right case wo not update going 1 right since school true 0. store distance either 0 plus 1 case 1. make sense yeah answer tp dp im case become 1 maximum distance 1. yeah right end return minimum dpims right minimum two one like yeah right coming gym value true 0 also true 0 since false infinity minimum 1 plus 1 2 answer 2 make sense yep make sense one second yeah no problem take time yeah uh zero okay either distance one max zero plus one not matter going one either infinity two plus one three three come gym distance infinity 0 plus 1 1 true 0 4 max 4 right return minimum 4 3 1 2 1. answer gotcha clear remind reason go right left skip final index what's logic behind essentially want see distances right right right element like no element right there's like calculated left right not calculate zero right already pre-calculation similar since uh calculation already done not separately yeah makes sense okay makes sense guess um final things um finding minimum index walk loud would yeah keep result right every time calculate dp im not upgrade result first citation since anyway i'm going right result equal minimum result dp going back like iteration right left going back uh calculate values okay one element not work case not calculating dp im least least two elements right one element n equal 1 return one calculate not done dp im first one right dp r equal essentially right resultant store result equal dp case one element plus mean case there's one element um guess could specified maybe input always two elements rather one one there's one apartment could go not really make sense uh good caught um could uh walk time space complexity algorithm yes uh block uh going requirements right n blocks requirements time complexity order nm also also order 2 nm essentially order nm space complexity also order nm since storing requirements yep ok great um better brute force solution like alluded beginning although think beginning minimum minimal distance sum still alluding brute force solution thanks yes expecting better complexity solution okay no great uh maybe final thing still roughly 10 minutes final thing um curiosity like would see ways would improve code maybe code perspective like sort pseudocode like part real code part pseudocode would um would like write function signatures things like uh obviously not taken correct naming conventions taken ieg written like not professional way naming conventions definitely change like taken vector vector called dp like third person reading not really make sense right maybe could named uh requirements distances uh like similarly naming conventions say could definitely done better oh return better way okay cool well listen kirk think think great super quick commentary see last 10 minutes interview second coding interview question hindsight think mistake interviewer already gotten really good signal kirti's algorithmic skills first question not gotten best signal coding ability not see code sort production grade formal quality even told would renamed certain variables things like hindsight think instead second question 10 minutes knew not going get coding part effectively reassessed algorithmic skills conceptual point view think would better rewrite code production grade quality formal grade quality would given signal coding ability mistake hindsight anyway i'm telling enjoy rest interview still roughly 10 minutes clock uh qrt we're going something completely different we're going switch gears um big tech company engineering team often care almost always care state code base specifically continuous integration tests unit tests running code base they're passing right not want tests failing sometimes engineers push code main repository fail break tests tests start fail right kind make sense yeah called team google build build referred kind like know whether code main repository works correctly compiles tests passing everything worked well would say build green everything not work well maybe like one test failed would say build red build failure okay okay i'm going give data going list lists booleans going something like let copy paste something something like going question number two going represent list could imagine value specific index represents like one hour one unit time there's true means build green build green build green next hour green everything passing suddenly false meaning not passing broken another hour false okay happens engineering team not happy want build green immediately want go fix that's see immediately next list fixed back true true true goes false broken engineer fix go back true right okay call lists effectively like build green green green suddenly breaks gets fixed call build run build run okay care team effectively like minimize time takes fix build runs right not want build runs false broken long period time okay want minimize um care data point something i'm going call green percentage effectively within build run percentage time build green versus broken longer greater percentage better like example particular array see green percentage eighty percent meaning build green eighty percent time broken twenty percent time got fixed okay want high possible specifically algorithm want give want take list build runs okay want return greatest number consecutive build runs strictly decreasing green percentage basically tells us longest like period time engineers increasingly slow fix broken builds make sense yes question come uh sizes list different like building different projects time projection number hours taken build no imagine represent hours basically like okay single code base build green green green broke broke two consecutive hours soon got fixed represent separate like list like code base effectively green green green gets broken gets fixed green percentage sixty percent okay percentage uh not like number hours anything yep not matter number hours okay okay okay uh thing question would like add that's want greatest number consecutive build runs consecutive lists like strictly decreasing green percentage since running time uh ideally walk come algorithm solved conceptually would not write code okay since supposed consecutive essentially uh longest decreasing sub array sort question right find sub array consecutive right not consecutive could subsequence could said longest decreasing subsequence right could done like normal dynamic programming since consecutive sub arrays keep two pointers two pointers one left pointer one right pointer left right percentage strictly decreasing less equal condition let's strictly decreasing okay move right pointer check okay uh added answer left right less right element earlier increase length 1 otherwise going update left pointer calculate resultant make sense uh right saying saying left right saying one pointer left main big list starts yes left essentially zero right also initially zero okay keep basically move right pointer right check uh percentage uh right less percentage right minus one moved right gotcha okay okay sorry sorry cut guarantee understand um going calculating percentages yeah pre-process keep number trues number falses number trues upon number truths plus falses 200 right would would like linear search oh we'll go entire list least right check many true many false yeah i'll walk least tell always start build runs definition always true turn fault okay uh lower bound return greater equal binary search lower bound essentially first place false right right that's right sort binary search uh calculate log n n size list um yeah log find percentage first place false came ones true know size list calculate percentage right exactly total time complexity algorithm would would travel entire thing say maximum size list n number lists order n log yep okay great um listen kirti we're time we're exactly like 46 minutes um think great covered least conceptually second question um think jump feedback okay okay cool i'm gonna stop timer feedback i'm actually gonna send link feedback form mock interviews uh algoexpert actually like similar feedback would get google google i'm basing google similar big tech companies google usually four main categories assessed right algorithms coding communication problem solving things things kind intertwined know things like handle uh curveballs ambiguity know um moment like disrespectful not react well stress things like we're going focus four main things think that's algorithms would definitely give four know best score not first question also second question little time came optimal algorithms solve question basically no help uh um clearly know demonstrated know work algorithms well right dynamic programming point binary search got right um really really well done um want we'll jump problem solving covering two problem solving often like pretty related algorithms would probably also give um four problem solving maybe would hesitate tiny bit three sense like know maybe room know could asked tiny bit clarifying questions beginning uh going path um minimizing sum like personally not really find big bad thing think know complicated question far like amount information gave um otherwise think approached problem well know covered talked edge cases asked like know empty array one element even handled case one element um covered little bit brute force solution beginning overall yeah think problem solving really point would give probably four quick commentary we're jump coding ability section feedback said first commentary middle interview think hindsight made mistake interview not get quite much coding ability signal would liked kierke interview see feedback kind err nicer side i'm little bit nicer qrt could ultimately real interview would done would left note hiring committee telling not get quite amount signal kirky's coding ability would liked gotten keep mind jump coding um coding notice end asked kind like would improve code think that's important ask interviewer know know sometimes um especially depending background like stress interview especially google doc write know go fast variable names like dp especially come competitive programming background dpdfs clearly like said would likely know cleaned code little bit renamed properly um also asked pre-processing stuff i'm confident could coding would would go anywhere three four know not think anything um really like red flag one thing maybe would made think red flag not tell anything could improved know not realize things like dp not amazing naming conventions things like otherwise think fine guess maybe one one point improvement would maybe given coding might subjective think well think algorithm probably runs perfectly stuffed lot stuff loops like instance keeping track final minimum index distance result think um know could entirely like separate function um could also done could could also separated um like maximums keeping track separate function like not know know worked well overall think would probably give three four okay would say subjective probably mentioned interviews might probably expect know increase complexity making another function know another call overhead yeah becomes cleaner like trade-off basically mentioned probably could quoted like well yeah guess want take one piece um feedback might help future interviews would like maybe least tell interviewer thinking could two different ways feel comfortable know single function single loop maybe would know easier readability purposes um know logic grocking purposes split different logical units yeah yeah yeah guess last one i'll say yeah general kind subjective find helpful kind think i'm going solve problem know let's say three different logical steps would number one know left right number two right left number three uh maybe guess right left approach always update things know makes sense would separated final step finding minimum index separate kind logical unit think overall think great think know we're page given said right okay um final thing communication uh communication would probably give would probably give three two like two half three not think would give two two two bit harsh think would give three uh like reservation would communication problem relatively complicated right even find solution really quickly clearly like problem not difficult pretty difficult problem lot little know things keep mind keeping track minimum maximum know skip last index skip first index think um know could maybe communicated tiny bit think interviewers might uh gotten little bit lost personally like approach really want make sure i'm understanding like i'll stop interview clarify saw couple times um ideally ideally like not let interviewer ideally one who's proactive who's like um clear know line i'm using not feel comfortable like know seems useless ask interviewer good great job ask interviewer like following want go detail i'm getting not overall would probably put three communication tally know got like foreign algorithms problem solving three half let's say coding three three half communication final score think would would inclined give strong higher know somewhere higher strong higher instance make decision i'd probably give song higher awesome ca not hired yeah mean yeah far i'm concerned know viewers see interview like think great job especially like pressure react feedback like feel good uh honestly thought would get lower score uh algo problem solving communication thing yeah first like challenging thing okay improve communication think yeah could communicated approach also little better yeah that's good feedback yeah also one thing keep mind like every interviewer little bit different assess know like one person might deem great amazing communication someone else might score tiny bit lower conversely algorithms might little bit different like personally found algorithm skills like really impressive like not stumble point immediately realized kind clever approach left right right left thing not expect thank much i'm really happy right well listen kierty awesome job um interviewer google still would give strong hire um would would hope um well interviews hiring committee saw way last words viewers guess people come uh mock interviews channel competitive programmers not uh like big high-five competitive programming good programmer small channel make hard questions explain simple way viewers like go check give feedback would like improve help well definitely i'll put channel um description
